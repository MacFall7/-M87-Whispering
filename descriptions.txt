"ER&M 287 - Reading Environments: Nature, Culture, and Agency": {
	Professor: Luna Najera
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Extreme weather, proliferation of species extinctions, climate migration, and the outbreak of pandemics can all be understood as instances of koyaanisqatsi, the Hopi word for life out of balance. They may also be viewed as indications that we are living in the age of the Anthropocene, a term in the natural and social sciences that acknowledges that human activities have had a radical geological impact on the planet since the onset of the Industrial revolution. In this course we study relations between humans and other-than-humans to understand how we arrived at a life out of balance. We inquire into how binary distinctions between nature and culture are made, sustained, or questioned through a diversity of meaning-making practices in Spanish, Latin American, and indigenous literature, visual culture, and material culture. The indigenous artifacts studied include Popol Vuh, poetry, petroglyphs, and documentaries by indigenous people of the Amazon, which provide opportunities for asking pressing questions: To what extent does the nature and culture binary foreclose alternative possibilities for imagining ourselves and our relation to the world? Are there ways of perceiving our world and ourselves that bypass such binaries and if so, what are they? In the final weeks of the course, we draw from our insights to investigate where the nature/culture binary figures in present discussions of environmental catastrophes and rights of nature movements in Latin America. Taught in Spanish."

"ARCH 3307 - Adaptive Reuse in Karachi: History, Documentation, & Intervention": {
	Professor: Kishwar Rizvi
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This seminar will consider the challenges of adaptive reuse in a global mega-city and will explore and enact the potential of cultural preservation to resist mechanisms of erasure that stem from capital-driven development. Karachi will be considered as an interdisciplinary case-study and working site, bringing together graduate students from History of Art, Architecture, and South Asian Studies. This multi-disciplinary collective of students and faculty with diverse backgrounds and skills in research, documentation, analysis, and design will work as a team to both learn from, and contribute to, ongoing work that is being led by The Heritage Foundation of Pakistan (HFP). The HFP, established by Sohail and Yasmeen Lari in 1980, has been documenting the British Colonial era buildings of Karachi and Lahore for several years. At present, Yasmeen Lari has designed a pedestrian pathway through Kharadar, with the help of local shop-owners, on the principals of community engagement and participatory design. Countering urban decay and climate change, the aim of this seminar is to consider how future architects, urbanists and historians may approach the issues facing the region. From this vantage point, we will consider the manners in which urban space is instrumentalized towards narratives of imperial and national identity; how gentrification and ex-urbanization effects historical city-centers; how revitalization projects must be understood ad critiqued; and what role collaborative and interdisciplinary study may play as a conduit and conveyer of positive solutions. Starting with a comparativist approach, the seminar will dig deep into the histories and cultures of Sindh, Pakistan, foregrounding how culture is made manifest through buildings and cities. We will then move to contemporary Karachi and how these histories confront the dynamics of a city of over 20 million inhabitants per the 2023 census. Finally, the group will take an in-depth look at Kharadar, its urban form and the forces that are shaping the context that HFP is working with and responding to. These three inputs will inform a mid-semester report integrating text and drawings collectively compiled by the student group in preparation for on-site fieldwork in Karachi. In Karachi, we will collaborate with the HFP, using the Kharadar pedestrian pathway project as both site and substrate to directly participate in an ongoing cultural preservation project. This fieldwork will include - collection of contextual documentation (architectural, oral, and historical); engagement with community stakeholders, policymakers, and urban designers; and collaboration with the shop-owners, craftspeople, and designers creating the pathway. Finally, we will work with HFP to outline envisioning a project that the students will undertake over the second half of the semester that contributes to the Kharadar pedestrian pathway, while also identifying strategies for its expansion in the old city. On return to New Haven, the student group will synthesize material from the fieldwork, articulate the scope of the project, and again work collectively to craft a design proposal, in text, drawings, and models, that is theoretically and materially responsive to the context of the old city and the contemporary forces that it is negotiating. The results will be presented to a group of academics, architect, preservationist, and Mrs. Lari herself, whose travel to Yale will be supported by the School of Architecture as part of a presentation and celebration of her career and work."

	Professor: Jason Schwartz
	Credits: 1
	Description: "For over two centuries, vaccination has been a prominent, effective, and at times controversial component of public health activities in the United States and around the world. Despite the novelty of many aspects of contemporary vaccines and vaccination programs, they reflect a rich and often contested history that combines questions of science, medicine, public health, global health, economics, law, and ethics, among other topics. This course examines the history of vaccines and vaccination programs, with a particular focus on the 20th and 21st centuries and on the historical roots of contemporary issues in U.S. and global vaccination policy. Students gain a thorough, historically grounded understanding of the scope and design of vaccination efforts, past and present, and the interconnected social, cultural, and political issues that vaccination has raised throughout its history and continues to raise today."

}
"ENGL 3456 - Writing Historical Figures": {
	Professor: Heidi Stalla
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Writing Historical Figures invites you to put into practice sometimes controversial questions about what it takes to bring historical figures to life, while developing a framework for discussing literary works based on real events. The course is structured in two parts. First, we study examples of life-writing (historical fiction, historiographical metafiction, autobiography, imaginative biography and object-biography) that blend the lines between real lives, historical events, and fiction—often looking contextually at what Virginia Woolf calls "history in the raw" living documents)—as well as competing narratives and controversies surrounding the works. During the second half of the semester, you put theory to practice by writing about a historical figure of your choosing. This half is writing intensive, but you get to choose an additional published work as your writing model and present this text to others in the seminar. The class features informal writing-to-learn exercises and two polished assignments: a creative work and a critical review essay in which you use the work of one or two chosen authors to explore the genre. In each assignment you work towards an understanding of both the power and the potential pitfalls of using literary techniques to tell a story about historical figures."

	Professor: Daniel Karell
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Backlash constitutes a large part of the public discourse and politics in the contemporary United States. For example, the #MeToo and the Black Lives Matter movements faced strong, well-organized, and very public opposition. Yet, social change has almost always encountered backlash, from the anti-bussing protests in Boston to the nationwide "tough on crime" rhetoric following the passage of the Civil Rights Act. What, if anything, is new about today’s backlash? More fundamentally, what constitutes backlash and what can we learn from both past and present instances of backlash? In this course, we will read and discuss scholarship on social and political backlash. Our goal is to better understand what causes backlash, how it manifests, and what its consequences can be. We also discuss how the academic scholarship has – and has not – studied social and political backlash."

"CPLT 991 - Law and Humanities": {
	Professor: Jesus Velasco
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This seminar suggests one possible introduction to the field and scholarship of law and humanities, from the perspective of philology and literary studies. Philology and law and philology and the humanities sport a historical relation of affinity that we explore. This affinity is not exclusively intellectual (an elective affinity between ideas and interests, as Weber puts it in his work on Protestant ethics and the spirit of capitalism), but also material: Philology, a central piece in humanistic traditions, is in itself an arch-discipline that shapes and studies the linguistic foundations of many other disciplines. Philology works consciously, but also unconsciously at a more elementary level across entire populations of both monolingual and multilingual societies. There would be no legal discipline without philology—but one can also say and vice versa, as many of the philological methods and procedures invoke legal thinking in a very deep way. We read theoretical sources from several periods as well as contemporary scholarship on the field of law and humanities. We touch on different legal traditions in several languages."

"AFST 753 - The Problem of the Fetish: Europe in Africa and Africa in Europe": {
	Professor: Alexandra Cook
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Nearly a century ago Marcel Mauss called for a retirement of the label "fetish" from ethnographic discourse on the grounds that it was no more than an "immense misunderstanding." While theories of commodity and sexual fetishism retain their currency, as a descriptor for African sacred and power objects the term fetish has long been obsolete in scholarly circles. This course serve as an introduction to what William Pietz called "the problem of the fetish" in its historical, theoretical and even material dimensions, and with an emphasis on its origins and afterlives in Atlantic Africa. We begin with the early modern emergence of the problem of the fetish in the creole trading enclaves of early modern West Africa and its Enlightenment refashioning into African fetishism. Then we trace its modern conceptual itineraries in ethnographic, art historical, psychoanalytic, and political economic discourses, both those aimed to produce an image of African people for colonial purposes and those designed to diagnose European social pathologies by "revealing the African within us." Finally, we survey the contemporary debates around what to call (and how to study) African art objects that entered museums and the historical record—often through highly nefarious channels—as "fetishes." Taught in English."

Real-life mysteries such as BigFoot, UFOs, people’s disappearances, and unsolved crimes have fascinated people for decades. How are we to understand this enduring part of our cultural life and locate the source of intense emotions that mystery ignites? This class focuses on mystery to provide a systematic introduction to basic concepts of cultural theory and the sociology of culture, such as culture and cognition, myth and narrative, modernity and secularization, the sacred and transgression, re-enchantment of social life, emotion, iconicity, clue, closure, and others. Dissecting concrete cases of real-life and fictional mysteries, we explore the basic principles of meaning-making, perception, and guess-making, emphasizing the role emotions play in these processes. Delving into a rigorous interactive analysis of cases and practicing joint research allows us to touch upon fundamental cultural concepts and theories at our fingertips."

"ANTH 615 - Anthropological Perspectives on Science and Technology": {
	Professor: No professor
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The course focuses on ethnographic work on scientific and technical topics, ranging from laboratory studies to everyday technologies. Selected texts include canonical books as well as newer work from early scholars and the most recent work of established scholars. Divided into four units, this seminar explores the theme of "boundaries," a perennial topic in anthropology of science that deals with the possibility and limits of demarcation. Each week, different kinds of boundaries are examined, and students learn to see their social constructedness as well as the power they carry. We begin by exploring where science is and isn’t, followed by the boundary between ourselves and technology, which is a specific example of the third boundary we examine: the one artificially drawn between nature and culture. We end with readings on geopolitics and the technologies of delineating nation from nation as well as thinking about postnational scientific states. Class discussion guides each session. One or two students each week are responsible for precirculating a book review on the week’s reading, and a third student begins class by reacting to both the texts and the review. The final assignment is a research paper or a review essay."

"FILM 646 - Uwe Johnson’s Anniversaries: From A Year in the Life of Gesine Cresspahl": {
	Professor: No professor
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Uwe Johnson’s Anniversaries: From A Year in the Life of Gesine Cresspahl remains a monument of postwar German literature—and it was written in and about New York City. Across its 367 short chapters (each corresponding to a day of the year), the novel unfolds on three levels: the historical present in New York, memories and family history from Germany, and reporting from the New York Times on current events. The result is a view of life, politics, and history in the middle of the twentieth century that is as rich and expansive as it is fragmented. The social and political climate of New York in the late ’60s is put into contact with memories of the rise of Nazism in Germany; reporting on the Vietnam war, the civil rights movement, and the Prague Spring is refracted through the lenses of the protagonist’s past life in East Germany and her new life raising her daughter alone in New York. This course undertakes a close reading of Johnson’s sprawling novel with attention to its many historical, political, and literary contexts. Readings from the novel will be complemented by relevant short readings in theories of media, politics, literature, and history. No prior knowledge of German language and literature is required."

"HUMS 146 - Nineteenth-Century Russian Literature": {
	Professor: Molly Brunson
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This seminar is an introduction to some of the most influential literary works produced in the Russian empire. From the formal experiments of Pushkin and the absurdities of Gogol to the celebrated prose of Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and Chekhov, the nineteenth century witnessed the emergence of a national literary tradition that would put Russia on the map of world culture. In this seminar, we consider the historical and contemporary impacts of this canon, while also situating these texts in dialogue with lesser-known works, relevant examples from the visual, performing, and musical arts, and in dense social and historical context. How did the formal innovations of these writers respond to the urgent questions of modernity and the ensuing transformations in science, politics, the economy, and the environment? How did writers of different genders respond to changing conceptions of family, professionalism, and subjectivity? How did these texts critique or uphold the ideologies that were motivating rampant imperial expansion and the violent subjugation of local populations? And of course, how are we meant to understand the "big questions" that have gained Russian literature global renown: love and death, fate and free will, belief and doubt, and the meaning of life? This seminar is rooted in the close reading of literary works, open and dynamic classroom discussion, and the liberal inclusion of historical, philosophical, and cultural context. No prior coursework in Russian culture or knowledge of the Russian language is required."

"PLSC 512 - The Design and Analysis of Randomized Field Experiments in Political Science": {
	Professor: Alexander Coppock
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Randomized field experiments are deployed across the social sciences to answer well-posed theoretical questions and to generate new information from which to build fresh theories of social interaction and behavior. Experiments are attractive because they enable the researcher to (mostly) ground statistical and causal inferences in features of the research design rather than assumptions about the world. This course covers the design and analysis of both introductory and advanced experimental designs, using the textbook by Gerber and Green (2012) as the main guide. Strong emphasis is placed on developing practical skills for real research scenarios. Given resources, how should subjects be assigned to conditions? How many treatment arms should be included? How do we plan to analyze the resulting data? The course has a relatively heavy workload: weekly problem sets in R that will prepare students for 95 percent of experimental research tasks they will encounter in the field."

"RSEE 606 - Socialist Realism and Its Legacies": {
	Professor: Claire Roosien
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Socialist Realism was promulgated in the 1930s as the sole mode for cultural production in the Soviet Union. Since that time, it has been maligned as totalitarian, lauded as emancipatory, dismissed as hackish, and reappropriated in a variety of ways—from homage to parody. This course offers an introduction to Socialist Realism and its legacies, beginning with its prehistory in the early Soviet avant-garde and other cultural movements, tracing its official adoption under Stalin, its reassessment in the late Soviet period, and its legacies after the fall of the Soviet Union. Special attention is paid to the interpretations of Socialist Realism in the emerging national cultures beyond the Russian SFSR. The course also examines select examples of the impact of Socialist Realism beyond the Soviet Union, particularly in the "Third World" during the era of Cold War cultural diplomacy. Questions for discussion include: How did Socialist Realism imagine, enforce, and unsettle hierarchies of gender, race, and ethnicity? What did Socialist Realism look like beyond literature: in film, visual art, architecture, and music? How did the imperative to use Socialist Realism connect to the Soviet project to create minority cultures that would be "national in form, socialist in content"? How did people outside the Second World co-construct and appropriate Socialist Realism?"
}

}
"RSEE 223 - Boredom and Catastrophe: Russian Literature After Stalin": {
	Professor: Spencer Small
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Life in the Soviet Union and early-post-Soviet Russia could be terrifying. It was frequently punctuated by war, political purges, and economic uncertainty. It could also be incredibly boring, from the monotony of Gulag camp life to the social decay of the late-Soviet Era of Stagnation. Both conditions, disaster and boredom, created ample room for Soviet and Russian artists to imagine alternate realities to the ones they were living. This course is a seminar dedicated to the study of Russian and Soviet literature as it developed after Joseph Stalin’s death in 1953. In it, we explore the afterlives and imagined futures of post-catastrophic societies, and examine the interplay between catastrophe and boredom as both symptomatic and constitutive of late-Soviet and post-Soviet life. Students are introduced to the essential, yet often-overlooked traditions of late-Soviet and post-Soviet literature and develop skills in literary analysis and cultural criticism. Our approach explores how Soviet and Russian literature appropriated and responded to national, cultural, and personal traumas, with particular emphasis on scenes of everyday life. All readings and discussions will be conducted in English."
}
"RSEE 249 - Russian War": {
	Professor: Spencer Small
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Russian War is a seminar dedicated to the study of war in Russophone literature and other media across the 20th and 21st centuries. This course investigates questions of genre and writing practices, authorship and readership, and historical and social interventions through art by examining canonical and non-canonical works from Russophone artistic traditions. Reading books, watching films, and playing the occasional game, we pose several questions: how has Russophone art reproduced and justified Russian war? How has it resisted and critiqued it? How are concepts of nation and ideology understood through war texts? How does form (books, films, games) affect how war narratives are conveyed? While Russophone, the course’s materials originate from myriad cultures across Soviet and post-Soviet spaces, including Russian, Ukrainian, Jewish, Belarusian, and Chechen. The course’s texts will span a variety of mediums, and include novels, short stories, poetry, oral testimony, film, video games, and photography. Through the close reading of a variety of texts, we explore the ways in which war is not only represented in literature and other media, but how it is repackaged as art fit for popular consumption. This course investigates the place of war in Russophone arts and cultures, and how art (re)produces histories and mythologies of war. All readings and discussions are conducted in English."
}
"RLST 628 - Religion and Family": {
	Professor: Todne Thomas
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Religion and family are also often depicted as separate forms of social organization. This comparative course explores the ways in which religious and familial concepts, institutions, and relationships intersect to shape the lived experiences of religious participants and those who construct themselves as kin. It also examines how religious and spiritual formations provide grammars for by which practitioners create and imbue their relationships with social and sacred significance. In particular, we examine how rituals, practices, and meanings surrounding reproduction, marriage, parenthood, siblinghood, and genealogy become important signifiers of religious identity and membership. It also explores how religion and family emerge as contested, politicized concepts that can be mobilized and debated in the public sphere. Our discussion of these case studies also opens up broader conversations about the politics of gender, fundamentalism, sexuality, patriarchy, and racism and their imprint on the modes of religious and familial belonging."

"EALL 277 - Music In Flux: Blendings, Exchanges, and Cultural Significances": {
	Professor: Wonseok Lee
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course examines how music is transmitted by various factors and how its styles and meanings can change in a new context. Through various scholarly approaches, this class aims to enhance your understanding of the mobility of music and its meanings. We will examine the processes and conditions in which music is exchanged and blended and consider how such "mashups" function as cultural indicators and symbols for emergent and migrant communities. We will also examine the impact of technology on musical globalization, localization, and glocalization. In doing so, this class explores issues of identity, representation, authenticity, tradition, nationalism, and transnationalism. By examining music in- or as-culture, students will understand some of the political, cultural, and social aspects of music, as well as the contextual meanings of musical practices. The class will utilize audio/video sources, incorporate discussions based on academic articles and chapters, and require student analysis that connects music to its context. While this class focuses mainly on music from East Asian countries, we will also examine case studies from others around the world.

"REL 849 - Preaching for Creation": {
	Professor: Carolyn Sharp
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This course considers ways to bear witness to the inherent value of Earth as a living and interconnected community that teaches profound theological and ethical truths. In discussions and preaching structured around mutual witness and deep listening, students explore such issues as: ways in which Scripture passages testify to the intricate glories and stark vulnerabilities of creation as a site of God’s transforming work; the beauty, giftedness, intelligence, and relational sophistication of nonhuman creatures; human sin as a major vector for harms that cause untold suffering in creation; and grace as the divine intention not just for humanity but for all living beings, Earth, and the cosmos. Engaging contemporary homiletical theory and studying sermons from expert preachers, students develop their homiletical skills and capacity to imagine, honor, and advocate for the whole community of Earth and its flourishing. Together students listen for the Gospel in sermons focused on creation, explore the potential of micro-homilies to build the capacity of faith communities for ecotheological reflection and creation care, and attend to poetry and memoir writing as sources of wisdom. There is no prerequisite; those for whom this will be their first homiletics course are welcome. This course meets the Homiletics requirement for the M.Div. degree. Area IV."
}
"REL 865 - Preaching on the Gospel of Luke": {
	Professor: Carolyn Sharp
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "Since the earliest decades of the Christian movement, the stirring Gospel of Luke has been cherished as an authoritative witness to the purposes of God revealed in the birth, ministry, death, and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth. Luke offers much of value for the preacher: narratives and poems that frame the Incarnation within God’s deliverance of the marginalized in the covenantal history of Israel; storytelling that underscores the power of the Messiah over imperial oppressors and spiritual forces of harm; ironic reversals that dismantle hearers’ assumptions about social and economic status; and a robust view of the disciples’ ongoing formation for proclamation and mission. We read rich exegetical and literary studies of Luke by New Testament scholars, and we learn from expert preachers who bring fresh angles from homiletical theory to their engagements with Luke. Students design and preach sermons and micro-homilies that explore the power of the Gospel of Luke for Christian communities of conviction. Area IV."

"NAVY 414 - Ethics and the Profession of Arms": {
	Professor: Lester Oberg
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Standards of ethical and moral behavior are integral to the military profession in the United States, but history has shown that ethical theory and practice on the battlefield do not always align. This course examines how moral and ethical philosophies have shaped the traditions of military service in the United States. However, the subject matter is applicable to all who aspire to positions of leadership, whether in the military, public or private sector.  Various theories of moral reasoning, including Aristotelian virtue ethics, stoicism, divine command, liberty and rights, utilitarianism, natural law, and moral duty are discussed and applied to military case studies from World War II to Afghanistan. Constitutional ethics, just war theory, and conduct on the battlefield are examined in relation to their influence on American military traditions and regulations. The course is centered around the following questions: Why is an ethical code of conduct essential to the military profession? When and under what conditions is the use of lethal force justified? What is the meaning of an officer’s constitutional oath? Is the "American way of war" consistent with our founding principles?"
}
"PHYS 345 - Introduction to Quantum Information Processing and Communication": {
	Professor: Steven Girvin
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course is intended for undergraduate physics, chemistry, engineering, computer science, statistics and data science, and mathematics majors seeking an introduction to quantum information science. There is now a second quantum revolution underway and a world-wide race to build powerful new types of computers based on quantum principles, and to develop new techniques for encrypted communication whose security is guaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics. The approach of this course to these topics will strip away much of the traditional physics details to focus on the information content of quantum systems, the nature of measurement, and why the true randomness of certain measurement results can be a feature rather than a bug. We learn what it means for a quantum bit (‘qubit’) to be simultaneously 0 and 1 (in some sense). We learn about quantum entanglement and the associated ‘spooky action at a distance’ that convinced Einstein that the quantum theory must be wrong. Ironically, this bizarre effect is now used on a daily basis to prove that quantum mechanics is indeed correct and used as a routine engineering test to make sure that quantum computers are working properly and are truly quantum. Specific topics include: the mathematical representation of quantum states as complex vectors, the superposition principle, entanglement and Bell inequalities, quantum gates and algorithms for quantum computers, quantum error correction, dense coding, teleportation, and secure quantum communication. Students learn to do problem sets based on programming and operating publicly-accessible cloud-based quantum computers. See for example: https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/."

"GLBL 280 - The Space Domain and Global Security": {
	Professor: Lester Oberg
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The outer space domain is increasingly important to global security and prosperity. Space capabilities enable unprecedented economic opportunities across multiple fields of endeavor, ranging from environment and agriculture to transportation, science, and banking.  At the same time, space has become essential to national defense: it underpins the ability of advanced militaries to navigate and track forces, to maintain robust communications, to detect missile launches, and to ensure effective command and control.  Yet the evolution in uses of space, and advances in space technology, create novel risks, vulnerabilities, and threats. This course aims to equip students with an understanding of the dynamic, rapidly evolving domain of outer space.  After analyzing some of the unique technical and legal features of the space domain, the class explores the strategic significance of space to American national security interests, particularly as space becomes more competitive among nations. The course also focuses on the rise of the commercial space industry, the growing number of space activities undertaken by corporations, and the role of public-private partnerships in ensuring the resilience of national space assets and the global space economy. In collaboration with the U.S. Air Force Academy, students also participate in an intensive space conflict tabletop exercise, assuming the roles of key stakeholders in an engaging simulation."

"REL 709 - Augustine’s Confessions: Autobiography and Biography": {
	Professor: Bruce Gordon
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This course is a close reading of Augustine’s Confessions together with Peter Brown’s classic biography, Augustine of Hippo. We examine Augustine’s account of his life through the lens of self-writing and the question of how to write the life of an ancient figure. What constitutes the self and can it be accessed by the author, the historian, and readers? We explore Augustine’s approach to self-writing as a work of theological, historical, and literary interpretation. Close attention is paid to themes of divine love, friendship, patria, pilgrimage, classical and Christian rhetoric, and Augustine’s approach to creation and time. While reading Augustine on his own terms, we consider a range of contemporary scholarship that raises questions of genre, psychology, gender, sexuality, environment, and race in the Confessions. This more recent scholarship is also put in discussion with Brown’s biography. The reading of Brown’s Augustine of Hippo alongside the Confessions enables us to explore themes of self-writing together with the craft of biography, with attention the instabilities of both. The seminar discusses the possibilities and limitations of both autobiography and biography, thinking about the problematic relations of the author to the self/subject, the development of narrative, as well as the role of the reader in the text.

"GLBL 7310 - Policy Challenges in the Sahel": {
	Professor: Bisa Williams
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course encourages students to examine contemporary policy challenges as handled in the Sahel: climate change, human rights, the status of women and gender policies, burgeoning democracies upended by conflict and institutional weakness, the influences of culture and religion, race and ethnicity. Students combine research and field work to examine how those challenges are addressed by international foreign policy practitioners as well as national and community leaders. The objective is to introduce students who know little about the countries of the Sahel to elements of its history, diverse cultures, and contemporary challenges. Led by a veteran US diplomat and former US Ambassador to Niger, the course introduces students to the cultural diversity, history, opportunities and challenges in the Sahel region as responded to by the international community and addressed by local and international actors. This course includes the opportunity for a field visit to Mauritania and Senegal during the spring recess. Enrollees for credit must participate in the field visit."

"GLBL 280 - The Space Domain and Global Security": {
	Professor: No professor
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The outer space domain is increasingly important to global security and prosperity. Space capabilities enable unprecedented economic opportunities across multiple fields of endeavor, ranging from environment and agriculture to transportation, science, and banking.  At the same time, space has become essential to national defense: it underpins the ability of advanced militaries to navigate and track forces, to maintain robust communications, to detect missile launches, and to ensure effective command and control.  Yet the evolution in uses of space, and advances in space technology, create novel risks, vulnerabilities, and threats. This course aims to equip students with an understanding of the dynamic, rapidly evolving domain of outer space.  After analyzing some of the unique technical and legal features of the space domain, the class explores the strategic significance of space to American national security interests, particularly as space becomes more competitive among nations. The course also focuses on the rise of the commercial space industry, the growing number of space activities undertaken by corporations, and the role of public-private partnerships in ensuring the resilience of national space assets and the global space economy. In collaboration with the U.S. Air Force Academy, students also participate in an intensive space conflict tabletop exercise, assuming the roles of key stakeholders in an engaging simulation."

"AMST 258 - Wilderness in the North American Imagination: What Was the Wild?": {
	Professor: Dolma Ombadykow
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course examines the history of natural science, with a particular attention to nineteenth and early-twentieth century colonial understandings of the wild, the civil, the self, and the other. The wild—whether the American West, the Gobi Desert, or the Amazon River—conjures visions of a place set apart by space, but also by time. In the western imagination, the wild is a decidedly historical—perhaps even prehistoric—place. Does the wild still exist, and what might the wild of the future look like? Centering critique from Black studies, Indigenous studies, gender and sexuality studies, critical race studies, and science and technology studies, this course asks: how have institutions like museums, zoos, the military, governments, and NGOs shaped our understandings of who, what, and when counts as wild? This course encourages students to think against dominant narrations of agriculture, conservation, natural resource extraction, tourism, and the promises of global commerce to attend to alternative formations of the natural. What roles do race, gender, sexuality, labor, and class play in our understandings of the wilderness? What does it mean for the wild to be populated, engineered, manicured, curated, or preserved? Each week, students will open class by introducing us to a place or a concept that pushes at the conceptual limits of the wild. Examples may be places or experiences of personal importance, like the family fish camp or an ancestral homeland, but equally permitted are explorations of, as examples, the rats of the New York City subway, the 1989 Exxon-Valdez oil spill, metastatic cancer, or microplastics."

"HIST 156J - Capitalism, Labor, & Class Politics in Modern U.S.": {
	Professor: Jennifer Klein
	Credits: 1
	Description: "History of American capitalism from the mid-19th century through the 21st century. This course examines different modes of capitalist accumulation and creation of landscapes, territories, boundaries. Readings address how regionalism, race, and class power shaped the development of American capitalism. We consider the continuum of free and coerced labor well after the end of slavery in the U.S. We read about indigenous communities, the environment, energy politics, and on-going struggles with the state. This mix of labor history, social theory, intellectual history, business history, social history, and geography also impel us to imagine the workings of American capitalism beyond the borders of the nation—to think about how capitalists and workers move through space and reshape space; the exchange of workers, ideas, technologies, and resources across national, imperial, and oceanic boundaries."
}
"ANTH 120 - Unequal: Dynamics of Power and Social Hierarchy in Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia": {
	Professor: Gojko Barjamovic
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The course "Unequal" examines the historical roots of intolerance, slavery, and imperialism, emphasizing how our perceptions of history shape contemporary beliefs and policies. It challenges the notion that inequality is an inevitable outcome of societal complexity, positing that historical narratives often frame progress and freedom while obscuring themes of inequality. By investigating early human history, the course aims to unpack the concepts of identity, possession, value, freedom, and power, exploring their impact on modern society. Rather than focusing on specific literature or chronological period, "Unequal" centers around critical questions about human culture. The course employs innovative experimental lab assignments, allowing students to engage with the past creatively, such as cooking ancient recipes, brewing beer, and creating virtual museum exhibits. This interdisciplinary approach encourages a deeper understanding of the historical context that informs present-day issues, inviting students to rethink common narratives and assumptions about equality and progress. Ultimately, the course aims to foster critical thinking about the interplay between history and contemporary society."
}
"ANTH 251 - Rituals of Land, Sea, and Sky": {
	Professor: Clayton Goodgame
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course investigates the many ways that human beings, as well as humans and other beings, relate with the environment through ritual. Throughout human history, one of the greatest aims of ritual practice has been communication with, and experience of the natural environment. And while the rise of modernity and "world religions" trained our eyes on more transcendent concepts of God, spirits of land, sea, and sky continue to impinge upon our lives. Here we grapple with how they do so: how societies around the world engage these spirits and other divine forms in the landscape and how they influence individuals, cultures, and entire civilizations. The course is organized in three parts. We begin with a series of historical and ethnographic cases in which communities large and small ritually engage with mountains, seas, animals, plants, and atmospheres. We then examine general theories of ritual and theories which address the aspects of ritual related to the ecological, the terrestrial, the chthonic, the atmospheric. Finally, we return to a series of empirical cases which challenge prevailing theoretical models, cases in which the human and the non-human appear to swap roles, or where the boundaries of religious and non-religious ritual disappear entirely."

	Credits: 1
	Description: "Seminar analysis of agriculture, from its revolutionary origins ten thousand years ago out of a million years of hunting and gathering, through selected periods of intensification, upheaval, and social transformation, to the post-industrial environmental and hyper-capitalization crises. When, where, and why did hunters and gatherers first practice agriculture? What were its societal effects? When, how, and why was agricultural surplus first produced? What were its transformative consequences? Are you surplus? What are the social and technological characteristics of intensive and extensive agricultural systems? Which agricultural system forces engendered western European capitalism? What environmental and social forces drive agricultural changes such as the invention and now global use of ammonium nitrate fertilizer? What will be the future relationship between agricultural innovation  and social change? The seminar integrates modern formulations and critical recent appraisals within articles, book chapters, and five classic films for analytic weekly discussion."
}
"ARCH 330 - Creativity, Innovation, and “The New”": {
	Professor: Mark Gage
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This seminar explores the role of "The New" in the design of our world. Through exploring the history of newness as an idea, its current understanding within philosophy, and examining its understanding in multiple creative fields today including art, architecture, product design, social microcultures, cars, food, fashion, and toys, students gain both knowledge about the role of "The New" in human society and are exposed to cutting-edge ideas in multiple disciplines. Through the study of emerging creative trends, detailed historic case studies, both philosophical and popular readings, and engaged group discussion we examine the very concept of "The New" from all possible angles—what it is, its history, why it is desired, the motivations of those that produce and promote it, who profits from it, and the morality of its continued rehearsal in a world with evolving ethics regarding the use of human labor and natural resources in the production of things. This course encourages students to consider these positions through not only research, presentations and discussion, but also speculative ‘making’ that challenges students to address the subject of "The New" themselves—through the very process of design. No particular skills or previous exposure to the design world is required."

"CSYC 224 - Approaches to Sustainable Food and Agriculture": {
	Professor: Mark Bomford
	Credits: 1
	Description: "What makes food and agriculture "sustainable" in light of the worsening climate crisis? Can organic or regenerative farming capture and store carbon in the soil? Can lab-grown meat revolutionize animal agriculture? How might urban agriculture and vertical farming impact food security and hunger? This transdisciplinary seminar considers the multiple roots and possible futures of organic farming, local food, urban agriculture, controlled environment agriculture, and related concepts, contestations, trends, and fads. Drawing from writings in agrarian political economy, science and technology studies, human and environmental geography, and the work of activists, organizers, farmers, entrepreneurs, policymakers, and beyond, we will examine the relations between land, labor, capital, technology, and society. The course includes three required Friday afternoon working visits to the Yale Farm at the end of the semester, which will ground our discussions in hands-on work in the soil."
}
"EALL 225 - A Culinary History of China": {
	Professor: Maddalena Poli
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Food is a central aspect of a culture, and culinary traditions often become tokens of identity. There are complex historical and social factors behind culinary choices. The Chili peppers now widely used in Chinese cooking were introduced in the region only in the 16th century. What socio-economic changes made this new spice so prevalent in Chinese cuisine so quickly? This seminar uses food as a lens to study major developments in Chinese history. We will think of food particularly in three ways; as a material actor, whose presence or absence affected historical events; as a metaphor, used by intellectuals to discuss proper government and other political topics; as a cultural mediator to shape identities in the social imaginary."

"EP&E 318 - Healthcare Business Ethics: The Moral Political Economy of Healthcare": {
	Professor: Ximena Benavides Reverditto
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course explores the intersections between the ethics, politics, and economics of the U.S. health sector. By adopting a critical thinking approach, we aim to explore how policy choices—and the laws in which they instrumentalize—have shaped the health sector to advance or prevent access to quality living conditions and medical services. This includes examining the power dynamics among the market’s stakeholders (e.g., clinicians, patients, hospitals, and the pharmaceutical industry, among others), reflecting on the factors that limit, ossify, or exacerbate their power, and questioning how power misallocations and imbalances may be promoted via policy choices from both public and private institutions. The core query is whether efficiency and equity can co-govern health institutions rather than one exclude the other. Our goal is to study the subject from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Throughout the course, we engage with multidisciplinary scholarship from public health, economics, sociology, history, law and political science champions and critics of health policy decisions and learn from advocates about the initiatives and strategies that can be used to address the moral and political problems of health policies."

"ER&M 129 - Politics of Religious Nationalism and Decentralized Resistance in Southeast Asia": {
	Professor: David Moe
	Credits: 1
	Description: "When does religious nationalism begin? How do ethnic and religious minorities imagine their identity and resist religious domination and political power? This course introduces students to the politics of religion, identity, and resistance in Southeast Asia. It examines how religion has played a role in both nationalism and resistance, from the colonial past to the post-colonial present. By placing James Scott's theory of decentralized everyday resistance in dialogue with Myanmar's everyday resistance movement against the centralized coup, we examine, through comparison, how the concept of "decentralized resistance" is applicable to elite political activists, grassroots peasant protesters, and ordinary religious practitioners across Southeast Asia's diverse democratic and undemocratic contexts. The course concludes by exploring how religion may also shape democratic visions of ethnic reconciliation amid ethnic conflict and religious hostility."
}
"ER&M 247 - Queer Historias from Latin America, Spain, and Latinx USA": {
	Professor: Ian Russell
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course departs from historias—both stories and histories in Spanish—to explore how sexual and gender dissidents express themselves, their pasts, and their futures. Across three units, we ask how queer subjects from Latin America, Spain, and other Spanish-speaking regions, including the U.S., use text and artworks to envision queer desires and relations as a part of history, especially when these histories are under threat of violence or erasure. By studying chronicles, short stories, poetry, performance, and film, we improve formal elements of expression in Spanish and answer important questions about how specific identity formations of sex, gender, race, class, nationality and migration status produce notions of history (and vice versa). Our semester culminates with a collaborative, creative project in which we build and exhibit our own 'queer histories.' Spanish is the principal language of this course."
}
"EVST 372 - Biochemistry and Our Changing Climate": {
	Professor: Karla Neugebauer
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Climate change is impacting how cells and organisms grow and reproduce. Imagine the ocean spiking a fever: cold-blooded organisms of all shapes, sizes and complexities struggle to survive when water temperatures go up 2-4 degrees. Some organisms adapt to extremes, while others cannot. Predicted and observed changes in temperature, pH and salt concentration do and will affect many parameters of the living world, from the kinetics of chemical reactions and cellular signaling pathways to the accumulation of unforeseen chemicals in the environment, the appearance and dispersal of new diseases, and the development of new foods. In this course, we approach climate change from the molecular point of view, identifying how cells and organisms–from microbes to plants and animals–respond to changing environmental conditions. To embrace the concept of "one health" for all life on the planet, this course leverages biochemistry, cell biology, molecular biophysics, and genetics to develop an understanding of the impact of climate change on the living world. We consider the foundational knowledge that biochemistry can bring to the table as we meet the challenge of climate change."
}
"GLBL 244 - The Politics of Fascism": {
	Professor: Lauren Young
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The subject of this course is fascism: its rise in Europe in the 1930s and deployment during the Second World War as a road map to understanding the resurgence of nationalism and populism in today’s political landscape, both in Europe and the United States. The course begins with an examination of the historic debates around fascism, nationalism, populism, and democracy. It then moves geographically through the 1930s and 1940s in Europe, looking specifically at Weimar Germany, Vichy France, the rise of fascism in England in the 1930s, and how fascist ideology was reflected in Italy’s colonial ambitions during the Abyssinian War. The course examines fascism and the implementation of racial theory and the example of anti-Semitism as an ideological and political tool. It also looks at the emergence of fascism in visual culture. The second part of the seminar turns to fascist ideology and the realities of today’s political world.  We examine the political considerations of building a democratic state, question the compromise between security and the preservation of civil liberties and look at the resurgence of populism and nationalism in Europe and the US. The course concludes by examining the role of globalization in contemporary political discourse."

It asks students to imagine how they might design policies and recommendations to help achieve peace and stability in Sudan. To do this, students take account of the recent academic and policymaking works on Sudan and to place this information within a longer historical context. What are the root causes of Sudan’s civil wars? What are some of the factors that determine the nature of Sudanese identities? What are the drivers of the current conflict? How might a lasting and just peace be achieved in Sudan? What are some of the main drivers of economic development in Sudan?"

"HIST 170J - American Jewish Citizenship Politics, From Revolution to Civil Rights": {
	Professor: Jacob Morrow-Spitzer
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Through a survey of primary and secondary sources on American Jewish political history, this seminar course studies how Jews theorized and mobilized on behalf of their citizenship rights in the United States, from the colonial era through the early 1970s. Although Jews were legally granted full "emancipation" by the federal government in 1790, constant changes in the size and power of the American state—as well as in the makeup of America’s Jewish population itself—challenged the very meaning of what full citizenship entailed. Over the following two centuries, Jews’ social, economic, and political rights as citizens often remained in flux. As a result, a vast array of different Jewish individuals and organizations mobilized behind different political movements to bolster their continued rights as citizens in America."

	Credits: 1
	Description: "Held in the Peabody Museum, this object-focused seminar explores feather art made by Indigenous people of the Americas from the 15th century through the present. Made from vibrant, agentive materials and often meant to be worn on the body, Indigenous featherworks raise critical questions about the art’s role in relation to sacrality, embodiment, and relations with the non-human. Through direct study of featherworks from Central and South America in the Peabody’s collection, the course explores different dimensions of feather art’s materiality and meaning, including animal-human relations, object agency, techniques of making, visuality, and issues of display."
}
"HSAR 467 - Rethinking Andean Landscapes": {
	Professor: Catalina Ospina
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This seminar reflects on the diverse ways in which different groups in South America, from the pre-Hispanic to the colonial period, articulated their relationship to the landscape. Many distinct cultures adapted to lush Amazonian forests, extreme altitudes of the Andes Mountains, parched desert coasts in the Pacific, and freezing Pacific waters. In order to survive, these civilizations developed unique relationships with the landscape and its resources, such as potatoes, coca leaves, marine life, cotton, alpaca, and metals like silver, gold, and copper. These relationships were significantly transformed by the arrival of the Spanish, resulting in social upheaval, religious conversion, new economies, the development of hybrid artistic styles, and ecological catastrophes. Our goal is to think critically about the kinds of objects and discourses we have to interrogate Andean relationships to the landscape."

"HSHM 206 - Body Politics: Histories of American Reproductive Rights, Health, and Activism from 1800": {
	Professor: Megann Licskai
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Are all politics reproductive politics? This course traces the reproductive history of the United States from the early nineteenth century to the present day. Questions about reproduction–and about not reproducing–are deeply tied to questions of gendered and racial rights; of bodily autonomy; of American expansion and empire; and of who counts as a citizen, or even as a human being. In the past few years, we’ve encountered new stories about everything from new and restrictive abortion laws, to immigrant woman who were sterilized without their consent, to new technologies in male birth control, to the inequitable childcare burden that falls to women during times of hardship, to the racist roots of foster care and residential school systems. In this course, we come to understand the historical changes in American reproduction to better understand the complicated roots of our current moment. By analyzing articles in newspapers and scientific journals, advertisements, film, patient and physician narratives, and exhibitions and material culture, students will understand reproduction as a site for empowerment and activism, as a site of medical professionalization, and as a site of health disparity. We examine reproduction capaciously, including pregnancy and childbirth, birth control and abortion, assistive reproductive technologies, and adoption and foster care. Our analysis is intersectional, and we consider what different identities meant for reproduction historically, as well as in our current moment."

"URBN 352 - Urban Lab: Citymaking and Food Policy": {
	Professor: Jacob Koch
	Credits: 1.5
	Description: "Food is an unusual issue for city governments and an everyday issue for people: we all have to eat. What we eat, where it is purchased, how it is prepared, the ways food is grown, processed, distributed, and how we dispose of it–these are all parts of the ‘food system’. This Urban Lab explores the food system through its many points of interaction with city government and the built environment. Engaging locally with food policy in and around New Haven, this Urban Lab embraces the illegible aspects of cities and resists looking at the city as a fixed concept. Rather, we approach the city as a site of ongoing processes–citymaking and policymaking as iterative, contested, and multi-sectoral practices playing out over generations and across political administrations. Beyond the local food system, we also look at global trends and Federal-level policies in food policy. The lab focuses on developing methods of relevance to the practice of urbanism, including site visits to develop a shared way of seeing, data gathering, documentation, and mapping with work critiqued collectively, and the use of non-academic documents."

"AMST 218 - Sex, Gender, and American Moderns": {
	Professor: Scott Herring
	Credits: 1
	Description: "What did being "modern" mean to those whose marginalized aesthetics negotiated sexual, racial, regional, national, and gender norms in the first half of the twentieth-century United States? This course functions as an intensive immersion into the creeds and concerns of recent scholarship regarding modes of U.S. modernity as the field overlaps with current forays into sexuality and gender studies. Via painting, photography, print culture, a "homosexual comedy," oral history and other resources, we discuss the popularization of heteronormativity in US sex manuals; the emergence of LGBTQ subcultures within and without urban East Coast environments; queer feminist agency through experimental photography in Provincetown; slumming and sensationalism in the Chicago Loop; and modern crip intimacies in Connecticut. Students meet the artists of the PaJaMa collective; James Weldon Johnson’s Ex-Colored Man; avant-garde Pacific Rim poets such as José Garcia Villa; a Nepali American surrealist; and a bohemian of the Harlem Renaissance whose drawings are held at the Beinecke."

	Professor: Joel Sanders
	Credits: 1
	Description: "BLM and COVID-19 have underscored the imperative for public institutions like art museums to reckon with a longstanding dilemma: museum architecture, working in relationship with the art it displays, perpetuation of white supremacy, heteronormativity, and ableism. This seminar uses the resources of the Yale University Art Gallery and the Yale Center for British Art to situate this contemporary challenge in a cultural and historical context by tracing the intertwined histories of art and gallery architecture from the 16th century to today. Looking back allows us to imagine alternative futures: we consider the work of contemporary scholars, artists, designers, and public health experts who are developing strategies for making 21st-century museums inclusive environments that promote multi-sensory experiences among people of different races, genders, and abilities."

This is an introductory course focusing on the literature, culture, and material artifacts of eastern Mediterranean communities from c.500 BCE-400 CE. Investigating these sources, we ask: How have the scholarly and popular categories of medicine, magic, and miracle aided or obscured our understanding of approaches to the divine, to ritual, to health, and to the human body? Should we parse these categories, and did the ancient individuals who used to lived in the eastern Mediterranean? There is special focus on stories of the miracles of Jesus and apostles, the cult of Asclepius, Hippocratic Greek medicine, the phenomenon of curse tablets and incantations in the ancient world, and non-normate ("disabled") bodies in antiquity, including those who identified as women.

"FILM 417 - Experimental Multimodal Videomaking and Exhibition": {
	Professor: Leighton Pierce
	Credits: 1
	Description: "In this course we make ten prompt driven one-minute video projects specifically designed to increase fluidity of thinking-through-videomaking. Some of the projects happen in class. Most are out-of-class assignments for which I give specific problems to solve or parameters to work within. Some assignments we design as a class. When we are not shooting or editing in class we exercise our critical skills by screening projects and discussing them. We take experimental approaches to the process of making these 10 videos as we glance toward the standard cinematic categories of drama, documentary, experimental film, and animation as we glide past. These categories are familiar, but not always productive, divisions among modes of production since none of these categories defines clear boundaries between practices. Instead, this class leads us closer to understanding the complex array of contingencies impinging on all filmmaking processes. We take an ecologically based, transdisciplinary attitude rather than a categorized genre-based categorization. We continually ask, how do the various aspects and approaches to a filmmaking environment  interact and modify each other? Through weekly prompt based video-making exercises, we navigate through a topography of filmmaking and exhibition practices."

"SOCY 340 - Carcerality and the Environment": {
	Professor: Alex Manning
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Mass incarceration is one of the most pressing social problems of the 21st century and it has become well understood that prisons perpetuate injustices for those that are detained within them and for those who live in the communities that surround them.  What is less understood are how the principles of carcerality are manifested in spaces outside of prisons and jails. As it currently stands caging, detention, punishment, surveillance, labor/resource extraction and restriction of movement are a few of the fundamental aspects of incarceration, but what this course explores is how these themes appear in non-traditional contexts such as animal agriculture, the environmental movement and institutions for the disabled. Carceral logics have a disproportionate impact on working-class people, poor people, communities of color and the more-than human world. This course examines to define carcerality, explore why carceral logics exist, address how carceral logics are manifested in non-traditional spaces and imagines a world without the carceral system. Throughout the course, we expand our understanding of the carceral system through an intersectional lens that addresses anti-violence movements, animal rights, prison abolition, environmental justice, disability rights and grassroots organizing. This course aims to reimagine what is meant by "mass incarceration" and through this reimagining we address what a deeply radical and intersectional decarceration movement might look like."

"CPSC 190 - Decentering Computer Science: Transpacific Computing History across U.S., East Asia, and Beyond": {
	Professor: Yoehan Oh
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Escalating conflicts between China, Taiwan, and the U.S. are mediated in part by semiconductor manufacturing and their advanced uses, like artificial intelligence. Inquiries into the transpacific history of computer science (CS) can teach us that these relationships have been much more dynamic than ‘Friend or Foe,’ and have shaped CS in various ways. When cutting-edge computing capabilities are at the forefront of national interests, studying CS and U.S.-Asia relations should no longer be separate intellectual tasks, and multi-view perspectives are needed to understand both processes. This course combines lectures with team-based activities to explore the decentered, international history of CS. We focus on the transpacific relations between the United States and East Asian countries, including Asian diasporas in North America. The course focuses on CS research and engineering, with less emphasis on (anti-)social implications such as mis/dis-information and data privacy. The subjects of study include: China-born first-generation digital computer pioneers; digitizing Asian characters; developing transpacific networks of computers and labor; transpacific works in building CS fundamentals.

"GLBL 338 - Humanity in the Line of Fire – Protecting Civilians in Today’s Armed Conflicts": {
	Professor: Federica Du Pasquier
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the brutal ongoing war in the Middle East have exposed the limitations of international law’s effectiveness in preventing violence and shielding the victims of war from its most brutal consequences. The challenges do not stop at these headlines: today, there are more than 120 ongoing armed conflicts, and over 160 million people need protection globally. Amidst the shifting balance of powers, tense geopolitics, and technological upheaval, what is the future of the protection of civilians in armed conflict? This course aims to equip students interested in pursuing a career in related fields with the right background, tools, and questions to do so effectively and creatively. Drawing on frontline experience, it does so by exposing participants to lived dilemmas and tradeoffs. The course consists of three parts, examining in turn the origins, principles, and legal anchoring of the existing protection of civilians’ regime [1]; contemporary challenges, including around ensuring compliance with international law [2]; and opportunities and threats faced by civilians amidst increasingly digitalized conflicts [3]. We conclude by taking a step back and asking a broader question: how does the protection of civilians relate to peace – and where are the peacemakers?"

	Professor: Pierre Saint-Amand
	Credits: 1
	Description: "In this course we study the major comedies written by Jean-Baptiste Poquelin, known as Molière (1622-1673), considered the greatest playwright of the French language (his plays are the most seen and read of all French writers). We analyze the plays in the context of the principal themes that have emerged out his theater and that made Molière the consecrated author he is: the critique of society, of the court, of religion; the education of women, the pervasiveness of money are other issues that will be discussed. Conducted in French."
}
"CLSS 859 - Aristotle’s On Ideas": {
	Professor: Tim Clarke
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The topic of this seminar is Aristotle’s On Ideas, a lost work in which he explored and criticized arguments for the existence of Platonic forms. Our knowledge of the work derives primarily from the commentary of Alexander of Aphrodisias on the first book of the Metaphysics. The class reads and discusses the Greek text of the relevant sections of Alexander’s commentary (In Metaph. 77-98 Hayduck) alongside related passages of the Metaphysics. This material in Alexander is of central importance for our understanding of Aristotle’s engagement with Plato’s theory of forms. Philosophical issues to be discussed include: the nature and range of forms; arguments for and against their existence; the contrast between Platonic forms and Aristotelian universals; the epistemological and noetic role of forms; their status as "paradigms" and their relation to perceptible things. We use Pantelis Golitsis’s new edition of Alexander’s commentary (Alexander of Aphrodisias:Commentary on Aristotle, Metaphysics (Books I-III), Berlin: De Gruyter, 2022) and Oliver Primavesi’s edition of Metaphysics Book 1 (available in Carlos Steel, ed., Aristotle’s Metaphysics Alpha: Symposium Aristotelicum, Oxford: OUP, 2012). We also read selections from the secondary literature on On Ideas, including Gail Fine’s major monograph on the work (On Ideas: Aristotle’s Criticism of Plato’s Theory of Forms, Oxford: OUP, 1993)."

	Professor: Tim Clarke
	Credits: 1
	Description: "A seminar on theories of time in ancient Greek and Roman philosophy, with readings drawn from Parmenides, Plato, Aristotle, Sextus Empiricus, Alexander, Plotinus, and Augustine. Topics to be discussed include the reality/unreality of time; its nature and definition; the relation of time to change; the distinction between time and eternity; the question of whether time is dependent on the soul or the mind. Texts are read in translation; a supplementary reading group is arranged for students interested in reading some of the relevant texts in the original languages."
}
"CLCV 085 - Socrates: an exploration of his life and thought": {
	Professor: Brad Inwood
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Socrates was probably the most influential philosopher in the western tradition, the idiosyncratic thinker and talker who shaped what it means to do philosophy and to live a life of philosophical integrity. He left nothing in writing, but his influence on Plato and others was so great that their accounts of his life, his conversations, and his limitless critical curiosity make him a vivid reality today. In this seminar we explore the most important of the ancient evidence for Socrates' life and work, for the most part the dialogues of Plato but including the satirical comic poet Aristophanes, whose Clouds is contemporary evidence, and Xenophon, who probably didn't know Socrates but who created an idealized character that influenced later interpretations of Socrates decisively. In this seminar students explore the evidence for Socrates' life, character and philosophical achievements through regular discussions and several short papers."
}
"THST 359 - Nature, AI, and Performance": {
	Professor: Matthew Suttor
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Can sound convey information? This interdisciplinary course explores how new technologies, such as artificial intelligence together with environmental data mapping, can deepen our understanding of the physical world and how performance might further enhance that understanding. Indeed, before and after Aristotle, the movement and behavior of large animal groups, such as the flocking of birds, have long fascinated humanity. Students will engage in hands-on experiments that translate natural phenomena—like avian murmuration or shifting ecosystems—into dynamic performative expressions, including music, movement, and visual installations. CCAM technologies in the Leeds Studio, including the motion capture system, multichannel sound system, and AI-driven data sonification and visualization software (developed with a Yale Planetary Solutions Seed Grant), allow course participants to collaborate across disciplines and interpret complex environmental processes in creative ways. Through this semester-long investigation of the physical world to the digital and back to the physical, students will develop new modes of storytelling that blend the arts and sciences to communicate the complexities of our planet."

"JDST 269 - Jews, Conversos, and Monarchs: Networks of Power in the Caribbean and the South Atlantic, 1391-1791": {
	Professor: Oren Okhovat
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course offers a survey of Jewish and converso history in the Atlantic World from the 1391 mass conversions in Spain to the French and Haitian Revolutions in 1791, with a focus on the Caribbean and the South Atlantic. The readings we discuss allow us to examine how the history of Jews and conversos was entangled with the history of empire, colonialism, and the emergence of the early modern world. One of the key goals of the class is to understand how traditional histories of Judaism and Jewish identity in the early modern Atlantic world must be rooted in the social, political, and economic histories of European expansion overseas. This is especially clear in the history of Portuguese Jews and "New Christians," who were the driving force behind the creation of Jewish communities in the Americas and along the West African coast during this period, and who will be the main subjects of our analysis in this class. To understand the social history of this Atlantic community, it is imperative to understand the networks of power that imperial institutions employed to shape early modern Atlantic spaces, particularly those of imperial administration, the trans-Atlantic slave trade and creation of slave societies, and the networks that individuals constructed across political and cultural borders. Like other minority groups, Portuguese Jews and New Christians were not only impacted by imperial political, religious, and economic systems, they also utilized them to their advantage. This is therefore a course that explores Jewish history within the context of empire and colonialism in the Atlantic world."

	Professor: Marlyse Duguid
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "Humans are moving species outside of their native ranges at unprecedented rates, and the resulting biological invasions present challenges for ecologists, conservationists, and policy makers alike. Through course readings and in-class discussions, seminar participants learn to critically assess contemporary conservation and policy decisions regarding the regulation and management of nonnative species. Using a framework from the ecological study of biological invasions we explore the major scientific questions in biological invasions, including "What makes a species invasive?" and "What makes a habitat invasible?" as well as more nuanced questions of how invasive species interact with native and other invasive species and how these interactions alter ecological consequences of biological invasions. Throughout the semester we discuss how invasion biology research informs policy decisions, assessing relevant policy questions such as "Should biocontrol agents be used against species invasions?" or "Should we eat invasive species to control their abundance?" This course is appropriate for anyone interested in learning how species introductions and anthropogenic change interact on a global scale and how to use the science of species invasions to inform policy and management decisions. By the end of the course, students have a solid background in the ecology and social dimensions of biological invasions. These various concepts are integrated through the discussion of case studies presented by a variety of practitioners and scientists working across different systems so that students get a broad exposure to the breadth and depth of scholarship and work in the field."

For forty years, in fact, its most ambitious literary texts and films (some suppressed, others widely popular) explored such contradictions, often in a vigilant, Brechtian spirit of irony and dialectics. This course examines key texts both as aesthetic experiments and as critiques of the country’s emerging cultural institutions and state censorship, recurrent political debates and pressing social issues. Texts by Brecht, Uwe Johnson, Heiner Müller, Christa Wolf, Johannes Bobrowski, Franz Fühmann, Wolf Biermann, Thomas Brasch, Christoph Hein; films by Slatan Dudow, Kurt Maetzig, Konrad Wolf, Heiner Carow, Frank Beyer, Jürgen Böttcher, Volker Koepp."

"EALL 298 - Politics of East Asian Digital Media Culture": {
	Professor: Tian Li
	Credits: 1
	Description: "East Asian digital media culture, ranging from cinema, television, musical video, to online games, has (re)shaped the global and national/regional imaginings of East Asia. The Post-Cold War intensification of intra-Asian interactions has precipitated the rise of a Pan-Asian regional identity wherein the nation-state is not yet obsolete. What role does screen culture play in the border-crossing interplay among languages, ideologies, aesthetics, and affect? How do we understand the storytelling and politics of East Asian screen cultures in relation to its historical and social context? How does screen culture capture local/global desires in a digital time? Within the contemporary media ecologies, how does screen culture create an audiovisual relation that traverses screen and actuality? How do screen culture continue to push forward the history of transformation of sign system from the written words to visual moving images in the contemporary sensory over-loaded world of screens. This course deals with issues of (trans)nationalism, (un)translatability, locality and globality, (post)modernity, virtuality and actuality, and politics of gender. Students learn how to think and write about screen cultures of East Asia in particular and of contemporary screen culture in general."

"ENGL 2854 - Interpreting Film Masterpieces": {
	Professor: David Bromwich
	Credits: 1
	Description: "A close examination of key films of the second half of the 20th century in Europe and America, following a generally chronological sequence from The Third Man (Graham Greene/Carol Reed) and Orpheus (Cocteau) in 1950 to Eyes Wide Shut (Arthur Schnitzler/Stanley Kubrick, 1999) in order to speculate on the modernist momentum of certain thematic and stylictic elements. Questions of cinema’s relation to social history and to the other arts will grow out of intense analyses of the films themselves and often of the fiction they derive from. We will monitor critics as they approach standout films, or try to grasp the import of cinema when taken at its highest level. Formerly ENGL 308."

"MMES 185 - Israeli Government and Politics in Comparative Perspective": {
	Professor: Reuven Hazan
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This junior research seminar presents an analysis, couched within theoretical frameworks from other Western democracies, of government, politics and society in Israel. The emphasis is on classification, typological mappings and model-derived explanations of how the institutions of Israeli democracy were structured, how they have changed over time, and how the social cleavages in Israeli society function and behave in the Israeli political process. The course begins with a review of some topics that might shed light on these issues, such as: the uniqueness/comparability of Israel; the history of Israel; the socio-political environment; the origins and development of the political system; electoral history. We then take up the core issues of government and politics in Israel, such as the makeup of the three branches of government and their relations in a country lacking a constitution, the electoral system, political parties and civil society. After becoming familiar with the Israeli political system, compared to those of other democratic countries, we tackle the more contentious issues and the challenges Israel faces today: the difficulty of government formation and survival; religion and politics; Israeli Arabs; the influence of Israeli politics on foreign policy."

"MMES 275 - Shi'i Islam, History, and Legal Thought": {
	Professor: Latifeh Aavani
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course provides a comprehensive historical analysis of Twelver Shi'ism, a significant yet often underrepresented branch of Islam. Despite being a minority, Shi'i Islam is the official religion in Iran and holds considerable influence in parts of Pakistan, India, Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen, and Bahrain. Shi'i Islam plays a critical role in shaping legal and political systems in these regions. We will explore the historical reasons for the emergence of Shi'a Islam and the division between Shi'i and Sunni Islam during the Classical Period. The course will examine key concepts of Shi'a Islam, such as the notion of the Imam and the various aspects of his authority. A particular focus will be on the impact of the Occultation of the Imam on legal, political, and theological debates within Shi'i law. A central theme of the course is the development of Shi'i law as a distinct legal school (madhhab). We will examine the methodologies of Shi'i jurisprudence and the debates between textualism and rationalism, alongside the emergence of Shi'i legal theory. The course will also address the relationship between the state and Shi'ism in Iran, particularly after the 16th century, exploring how the Shi'i ulama (scholars) contributed to constitutional movements and how Shi'ism has influenced the Iranian Revolution and contemporary life in Iran."

"NELC 443 - Classical Persian Epic": {
	Professor: Jane Mikkelson
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course acquaints students with some of the most famous epics of classical Persian literature. A remarkably capacious literary form, the Persian masnavī (long narrative poem) can be heroic, historical, religious, philosophical, didactic, popular. As we attend minutely to matters of grammar, form, prosody, and style, we also keep in view relevant literary, cultural, historical, and intellectual contexts. An essential objective of the course is to introduce students to some of the ways in which the premodern Persian tradition thinks about itself. To that end, primary readings are supplemented with short extracts from works by medieval and early modern theorists, critics, philosophers, and literary historians. Achieving a fine-grained view of the tradition from within illuminates our discussions as we consider the distinctiveness of the epic genre and its ability to foster creative conjunctions across myth and history, philosophy and allegory, religion and entertainment, oral and written literary cultures. Thinking critically about the scope, history, and exportability of terms like masnavī, epic, and romance leads us into broader conversations about how best to situate classical Persian literature within (or against) world literature—and what that might mean for comparative, entangled, and multifocal histories of the epic form."

"AFAM 707 - What Is An Archive?": {
	Professor: Melissa Barton
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This graduate seminar seeks to answer the question in the course’s title by looking closely at professional archival descriptive practices and broader, looser uses of the term in cultural and literary studies, art history, history, and beyond. By looking at these distinct but curiously, even suspiciously, concurrent genealogies, we seek to explain why the term "archive" has become so demonstrably popular, in multiple senses of the word, even as archival practice has become more professionalized and specialized. Put differently, many humanistic fields have undergone "archival turns" in recent decades, and many cultural and performance theorists, critics, and historians have advanced arguments about "the archive" as a monolithic concept, perhaps "the archives" as an abstract location where the work begins (e.g., "I’ve been in the archives"), or perhaps "my archive" as the group of texts I interpret and cite. Meanwhile, professional archivists regularly publish tweets, articles, and blog posts asking them to stop it. This course hopes to ponder and maybe even find a way toward an answer to the question: What is up with this? We explore archives in theory and practice, as both figurative and literal, both concrete and abstract, repositories for "primary" inquiry into the past. We consider theories of archives from humanities fields and the archival profession (including the emerging subfield "critical archival studies"), and we discuss how archives are made, how they are used, how they are made usable, what may be assumed or elided in the making and use of archives, and the popularity of, and tensions around, "the archive" as a concept. Topics and keywords include: what is primary or original? What is order or process? What is a trace, and how is it made distinct from the great mass of human traces? What does it mean to collect, to curate? What is an archival silence, and what might be comparable notions of archival noise? What does it mean to recover or discover? In addition to readings, students complete two assignments: a provenance research assignment and a descriptive project in the form of a survey of an existing collection at Yale or a subject guide to a collection or group of collections."

	Professor: Ayesha Ramachandran
	Credits: 0.5
	Description: "This year-long workshop focuses on the concepts, debates, methodologies, theories, and real-world constraints of the material histories of the human record across a range of formats and media. Organized around six rubrics—Collecting, Describing, Displaying, Embodying, Disembodying, and Representing—we aim to cut across long-standing divides between collections, archives and libraries, on the hand, and scholarly/artistic spaces of the academic world; between preservation and consumption; between privacy and publicity; between the social sciences and the humanities. Through critical readings that engage with diverse geographic and temporal subjects; the close analysis and physical handling of rare books, maps, manuscripts, images, objects, and textiles; and an orientation to cultural heritage and library professional practices and procedures, students learn the critical interventions of the history of the book and the archival turn in the humanities; the key concepts and genealogies of archives and library special collections; and the generative collaborations currently underway between faculty and librarians to jointly address legacies of racism and white privilege, advance intellectual freedom and parity, and define the ethical stewardship of the material histories of the human record today. This workshop takes the form of a half-credit course in each semester that meets six times a term (every other week). This course must be taken before or after MHHR 700 to earn 1 full credit. We welcome all curious students to the first class, but permission of the instructors is subsequently required for enrollment/registration."

"NELC 725 - New Kingdom Archaeology": {
	Professor: Nadine Moeller
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The New Kingdom period of ancient Egypt (1550–1069 BC) is one of the most vibrant and culturally diverse time periods. Egypt had its first empire and became a major political and economic player within the ancient Near East. Egyptian culture and society was exposed to foreign influence but also evolved internally with its elaborate funerary architecture, royal and private, and saw the emergence of impressive royal cities. This course has the aim to investigate the archaeological data, architecture and corresponding material culture of New Kingdom Egypt (ca. 1550–1069 BCE). We discuss funerary and settlement evidence and the readings are selected according to their overall significance for current research. The aim is to provide a comprehensive overview of the available data and include recent discoveries such as Amenhotep III’s "Golden City" on the Theban West Bank and the royal burials along the wadis of the Western Desert. Egypt’s contact and influence in the Levant and Nubia are addressed as well, with the aim to achieve a more balanced perspective of these two regions and their populations interacting with Egyptian society."

"PHAR 540 - Qualifying Exam Prep Class for Pharmacology": {
	Professor: Mark Lemmon
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The goal of this class is to teach students to conceive, write, and defend a grant proposal. The timing of this half-term course is aligned with the pharmacology qualifying exam in the spring term, for which a written research proposal is required. This course takes students through the steps of proposal writing, guiding them in defining a problem of their own and training them in the mechanics of writing. Additional support is given as needed to students with more limited writing experience. By taking the "guesswork" out of the writing process, students can focus on the development of their research proposal without the added anxiety associated with an unfamiliar process. Students learn about the structure and components of fellowship and grant proposals. They engage in "mock study sections", providing written critiques and participating in discussion of sample proposals assigned by the instructors. Students give oral presentations of their specific aims followed by classroom discussion. At the end of the course, students will have made substantial progress toward completing the written portion of their qualifying exam and gained a set of competencies central to this program. Open to graduate students only.  Priority is given to pharmacology students."

"MDVL 833 - The Passion in Late Antique and Byzantine Art": {
	Professor: Felicity Harley
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The English word "passion" refers to the redemptive suﬀerings of Jesus and to the narrative of events leading up to and including his death, particularly as recorded in the four canonical gospels. The story of the Passion seems perfectly suited to illustration in view of the narrative structure of the gospel accounts, along with the broader theological significance attributed to the death of Jesus in the early church, and certainly this is the case from the eighth century on, when illustrated passion narratives came to form the bedrock of Christian visual culture. This seminar begins by examining these four accounts and then examines the earliest evidence for their representation and interpretation in visual art, hymnography, liturgy, and homiletic literature. Focusing on specific themes—such as the Betrayal, Crucifixion, and Resurrection—it then explores the ways that the Passion was imagined, exploited, and appropriated in Late Antiquity and Byzantium, when it motivated the creation of consequential works of art in conjunction with the composition and performance of hymns, complex liturgies, and homiletic literature that came to define personal piety as well as theology. The seminar includes a site visit to the Yale University Art Gallery and the viewing of Byzantine manuscripts in the form of facsimiles."

"SKRT 142 - The Bhagavad-Gita": {
	Professor: Aleksandar Uskokov
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course focuses on the most famous and influential of Hindu texts, the Bhagavad-gītā, which is a part of the great epic of South Asia the Mahābhārata. With respect to language, special attention is paid to morphology and style that are typical of epic Sanskrit. With respect to content, the Bhagavad-gītā is contextualized in terms of the verse Upaniṣads, such as Śvetāśvatara and Muṇḍaka, on which it often draws. Finally, in the last five weeks of the semester, alongside the main text we also read from the classical commentary of Śaṅkara, with a focus solely on techniques of glossing and word and compound analysis (and avoiding doctrinal polemic). The course, thus, provides a soft introduction into the practices and technical vocabulary of Scholastic Sanskrit."

Drawing on sources ranging from colonial travel accounts and trade diaspora histories to black critical theory and fiction, we examine theorizations and representations both about migration and by diasporic peoples to unsettle and re-theorize imaginaries of globalization, nationalism, and the politics of belonging."
}
"AFAM 373 - African Kings from the Sahel to Salvador": {
	Professor: Alexandra Cook
	Credits: 1
	Description: "When Spanish and Portuguese sailors, merchants, and missionaries began to encircle the African continent, they did not find a lawless land, as certain ancient writers had predicted: they came face to face with African kings and queens. Most of these rulers would not have answered to "King" or "Queen", but to Negus, Mansa, Oba, Mwene, or Aláàfìn, among others. Yet as major players in global circuits of conversion and commerce, and the written and visual archives these circuits produced, these rulers and their stories inevitably appear in translation, in Arabic, Portuguese, Spanish, French, Dutch and Latin and beyond. When Africans were transported by force at an industrial scale to build the New World, they brought with them and reinvented these political grammars and epistemologies of power, exploring their subversive potential in ways that remain vital today. In this class we study African Kingship in all its meanings and manifestations, on the continent and in the Americas, from founders of empires to emperors of carnival. We study rituals and displays of power; kings as guardians of the sacred; kings as enslavers and kings enslaved. We study Impostor Kings, Maroon Kings, Carnival Kings, Imaginary Kings, Leper Kings, and more."

"GLBL 435 - The Return of Great Powers: Navigating a New and Uncertain World Order": {
	Professor: James Sciutto
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course is a study of a new, unstable world order, with the great power US and its allies in Europe and Asia competing with great power adversaries China and Russia, and allies Iran and North Korea. This new order coincides with a decline in US influence, with its position as sole superpower now past. This course escapes the ivory tower for the many fronts of this emerging conflict – from Ukraine to Taiwan to a new "great game" among the powers in the Global South. It also explores the many new technological fronts in cyberspace, outer space, and the rapidly expanding fields of drone warfare and AI - many of which didn’t exist in the last Cold War. We approach this course as witnesses to history unfolding before our eyes, and as aspiring policymakers, discussing ways to reduce the risk this new Cold War turns hot. For the US and its allies, this is a 1939 moment, as this century’s despots attempt to remake the world by force of arms. For all nations, it is a test of their ability to defend strategic interests while avoiding a devastating great power war."
}
"ARCH 339 - Architecture of Illness": {
	Professor: Fatima Naqvi
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course looks at the rise of the hospital from the mid-19th century onward and what this meant for people’s experiences of illness. Around 1880, hospital construction boomed in the Western world, especially in medical centers like Vienna, Berlin, and Paris. A variety of building styles—ranging from corridor to pavilion constructions—were employed to take into account new standards of hygiene and advances in medical treatment. By the mid-20th century, megastructures had replaced the originally smaller buildings, with increasingly large areas devoted to technology, heating, ventilation, and cooling. The seminar focuses on how clinics were experienced with a great deal of skepticism from the outset, as sites of metaphorical and literal contagion. Patients perceived clinics as places structured by intricate gatekeeping mechanisms and internal hierarchies—a fact refracted in many texts centering on clinics, hospitals, and sanatoria. Studying a range of novels, dramas, and films that deal with the architecture of illness, we focus on biopolitical concerns, as well as on architectural elements and the experiential dimensions of clinical spaces. We talk about the rise of the specialist, the increasing role of technology, and the concept of care. The architecture of medicine and the medicalization of architecture have important implications for how we think about sickness and health today—and how we experience clinical spaces now."

}
"ANTH 397 - Archaeology of East Asia": {
	Professor: Kirie Stromberg
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This interdisciplinary seminar explores the ways early East Asian cultures represented the human face and form. Elite individuals and deities are rarely represented East Asian visual culture before the entrance of Buddhism into China at the end of the first millennium BCE. The fact that the earliest cultures of China, Korea, and Japan did not prioritize realistic representation of elite human bodies remains a major point of contrast vis-à-vis other early civilizations. Focusing on excavated materials, this seminar covers ways in which these cultures portrayed the human (or human-like) face and body, primarily from Paleolithic through late Bronze Age contexts, highlighting how the entrance of Buddhist iconographic traditions radically shifted local contexts in the second half of the course. In addition to challenging students to reevaluate their preconceptions of what kinds of objects should center art historical cannons, this course provides firm grounding in the formation of social complexity and other themes foundational to anthropological study of the pre- and early history of China, Korea, and Japan. All core readings are in English, but students with proficiency in East Asian languages are provided with relevant resources."

"GMAN 200 - Yiddish Humor: A Genealogy": {
	Professor: Joshua Price
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course offers a history of Yiddish humor across four centuries of media: religious polemic, short stories, folktales, standup, theater, and film. Along the way, and hopefully without ruining too many jokes, we explore the functions of humor for a minority, diasporic culture: Enlightenment-era projects of reform and uplift; compensations ("laughter through tears") for the assaults of modernity (intractable antisemitism, communal atomization); the sheer delights of both self-critique and "punching up" at clueless powers-that-be; and finally, the necessity and insufficiency of humor after the Holocaust. Our sources range from the canonical (Sholem Aleichem, IB Singer, Mel Brooks) to the under-appreciated (S. Liptzin, M. Karpilove). We also consider how Yiddish came to be seen as inherently funny — not just a medium but also an object of humor, particularly in its global circulation in German (S. Freud, F. Kafka); Russian (I. Babel); Hebrew (D. Grossman); and English (G. Paley)."

"CPSC 683 - Stability in Machine Learning: Generalization, Privacy, and Replicability": {
	Professor: Alvertos Kalavasis
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course is about generalization and stability of machine learning (ML) systems. There are various ways to define what it means for a learning algorithm to be stable. The most standard way is inspired by sensitivity analysis, which aims at determining how much the variation of the input can influence the output of a system. This abstract way allows one to introduce various notions of stability such as uniform stability, differential privacy, and replicability. In this course, we investigate these notions of stability, their applications, and their surprising connections. Permission of instructor required."

"ENGL 2021 - Culture as Data: Thinking Computationally with Text": {
	Professor: Sayan Bhattacharyya
	Credits: 1
	Description: "We live in a world that is increasingly quantified and made subject to measurement across various dimensions. We have long been accustomed to think of the study of culture as primarily qualitiative, but the relatively new field of digital humanities tends to argue that present-day computational tools, up to and including those produced by the currently ongoing generative AI upheaval, have put at our disposal the capacity to supplement our traditional interpretive study of culture with digital methods that can enrich, augment and sometimes even question the insights we obtain from qualitiative inquiry alone. Looking at textuality as paradigmatic of the humanistic study of culture, with a combination of readings and hands-on tinkering, explore this approach and its limitations. Methods investigated in the course is a selection of modern twenty-first century computational techniques such as vector semantics, topic modeling, and commonly used frameworks and toolkits for machine learning with text. No prior computer programming knowledge will be assumed, and the course itself teaches students the extent of programming expertise needed in the Python programming language to put together customized text processing and analysis workflows from existing open-access building blocks and libraries."

"EPS 725 - Carbon Dioxide Removal in Working Lands": {
	Professor: Noah Planavsky
	Credits: 1
	Description: "It is becoming increasingly accepted that widespread carbon capture is going to be required to stabilize atmospheric carbon dioxide at levels commensurate with mitigating widespread environmental and economic degradation in the coming century. For example, even in a scenario with net-zero carbon emissions, by 2040 global average temperature is likely to increase beyond the 1.5˚C warming threshold that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns, if exceeded, will lead to significant and widespread regional degradation of livelihoods, food security, and water supply. In this seminar, we explore the largest scientific unknowns associated with carbon capture via enhanced silicate weathering and long-term sequestration of organic matter, as well as the risks and challenges associated with implementing these geoengineering strategies. Undergraduates can be admitted by permission of the instructor."

"THST 471 - Directed Independent Study": {
	Professor: Hal Brooks
	Credits: 1
	Description: "An independent study should generally conform to the standards and procedures of the senior project, THST 491, even when not undertaken by a senior. If the independent study is a performance or directing project, the adviser visits rehearsals and performances at the mutual convenience of adviser and student. The project must be accompanied by an essay of about fifteen pages, worth about half the final grade. Although the paper's requirements vary with the project and its adviser, it must be more than a rehearsal log. The paper typically engages interpretative and performance issues as revealed in other productions of the work (if they exist). The writing should be concomitant with rehearsal, to enable each to inform the other, and a draft must be presented to, and commented on by, the adviser at least a week before—not after—the final performance. The final version of the paper, incorporating adjustments and reflections, should be turned in to the adviser no later than ten days after the performance closes, and no later than the first day of the final examination period. An essay project entails substantial reading, at least four meetings with the adviser, and a paper or papers totaling at least twenty pages. A playwriting project normally requires twenty new script pages every two weeks of the term and regular meetings with the adviser. A final draft of the entire script is the culmination of the term's work. Application forms are available from the director of undergraduate studies. Juniors may use one term of these courses to prepare for their senior projects."

These include but are not limited to theater or dance projects (performance, design, or direction); an essay or research project within theatrical, dance or performance literature; including history, theory, and criticism or performance research, analysis, and design; or a writing project.  As the final product varies from discipline to discipline (a musical score is different from a play script; a dance work is different from a design concept), it is incumbent upon the student and their adviser to determine the required number of pages, the final form of the project to be determined, and if there is a public presentation of the work. Application forms are available from the DUS of Theater, Dance, and Performance, who has more detailed information about the writing and research that each form may entail."

"EDST 205 - Principles of Effective Teaching in the Secondary Classroom": {
	Professor: Melissa Scheve
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Children across America spend roughly 12,000 hours in school from kindergarten through grade 12. How those instructional hours are spent dramatically impacts students’ academic and personal well-being. Many studies have demonstrated that teacher quality matters to students’ long-term outcomes including graduation and job placement. In this course, we delve into the essential principles of being an effective teacher, focusing specifically on the U.S. secondary classroom. Building community, designing culturally sustaining curriculum, teaching inclusively, and assessing students authentically are a handful of the principles we explore together through articles about teacher practice, video examples of classroom practice, and students opportunity to enact some of these practices during class. Each student is paired with a current secondary public school teacher across America to engage in a case study of effective teaching throughout the seminar. By the end of this course, you learn some core principles of effective teaching, gain an understanding of the complexities of enacting effective teaching practices given educational inequities, conduct a case study about effective teaching, and practice some aspects of secondary teaching."

"HIST 444J - Queer Science": {
	Professor: Joanna Radin
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Why are there so many studies involving trans brain scans? Can facial recognition technology really tell if you’re queer? Why is everyone so obsessed with gay penguins? For that matter, how did science come to be the right tool for defining and knowing sex, gender, and sexuality at all? How does that history influence our collective lives in the present, and what are some alternatives? This course gives students a background in the development of sex science, from evolutionary arguments that racialized sexual dimorphism to the contemporary technologies that claim to be able to get at bodily truths that are supposedly more real than identity. It introduces scholarly and political interventions that have attempted to short-circuit the idea that sex is stable and knowable by science, highlighting ways that queer and queering thinkers have challenged the stability of sexual categories. It concludes by asking how to put those interventions into practice when so much of the fight for queer rights, autonomy, and survival has been rooted in categorical recognition by the state, and by considering whether science can be made queer."

"ENV 807 - Corporate Sustainability: Strategy and Management": {
	Professor: Daniel Esty
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This survey course focuses on the policy and business logic for making environmental issues and sustainability a core focus of corporate strategy and management. Students are asked to analyze when and how sustainability leadership can translate into competitive advantage by helping to cut costs, reduce risk, drive growth, and promote brand identity and intangible value. The course seeks to provide students with an introduction to the range of sustainability issues and challenges that companies face in today’s fast-changing marketplace. It introduces key corporate sustainability terms, concepts, tools, strategies, and frameworks based on the overarching theory that the traditional profit-maximizing mission of business (often called shareholder primacy) is giving way to a new vision of stakeholder responsibility that still seeks to provide good returns to the enterprise’s owners but also acknowledges obligations to employees, suppliers, customers, communities, and society more broadly. The course combines lectures, case studies, and class discussions on management theory and tools, the legal and regulatory frameworks that shape the business-environment interface, and the evolving role of business in society. It explores how to deal with a world of diverse stakeholders, increasing transparency, and rising expectations related to corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. Self-scheduled examination."

"LAST 345 - Making the Revolution: The Sixties in Latin America": {
	Professor: Olivia Lott
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The 1960s was a time of turmoil and transformation. The decade was marked by Cold War political tensions, social unrest, and drastic reconfigurations of the cultural sphere across much of the globe. More than fifty years later, the crises and social reckonings of the ‘60s increasingly speak to what we are living through today, underscoring the significance of the decade for understanding our contemporary world order—and, perhaps, how we imagine alternatives and make change. This course offers an exploration of the cultural production from the "long 1960s" in Latin America (1959-1973) alongside the decade’s major historical events, social shifts, and political debates. We cross borders of nation and genre, concentrating on transnational trends and cultural production built for immediate, often ephemeral impact. Materials include visual poetry, investigative journalism, manifestos, literary magazines, newsreels, documentary films, music, political cartoons, photographic projects, proposal art, and artistic "actions." Students complete both critical and creative assignments. The course culminates with a "Pop-Up Exhibition" of student sixties-inspired projects, open to the Yale community. Taught in Spanish."

"ENV 835E - Seminar on Land Use Planning": {
	Professor: Jessica Bacher
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "Land use control exercised by state and local governments determines where development occurs on the American landscape, the preservation of natural resources, the emission of greenhouse gases, the conservation of energy, and the shape and livability of cities and towns. The exercise of legal authority to plan and regulate the development and conservation of privately owned land plays a key role in meeting the needs of the nation’s growing population for equitable housing, energy, and nonresidential development as well as ensuring that critical environmental functions are protected from the adverse impacts of land development. This course explores the multifaceted discipline of land use and urban planning and their associated ecological implications. Numerous land use strategies are discussed, including identifying and defining climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, including affordable housing, community revitalization, energy development and siting, equitable community engagement, transit-oriented development, building and neighborhood energy conservation, distressed building remediation, jobs and housing balance, coastal resiliency, and biological carbon sequestration. The course also explores how recent events impact these planning issues. The focus is on exposing students to the basics of land use and urban planning, especially in the United States but also internationally, and serving as an introduction for a YSE curricular concentration in land use. Guest speakers are professionals involved in sustainable development, land conservation, smart growth, renewable energy, and climate change management."

"HPM 559 - Big Data, Privacy, and Public Health Ethics": {
	Professor: Jennifer Miller
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This course provides an introduction to ethical theory and decision-making applied to real-world cases at the intersection of big data and public health. The first part of the course focuses on patient medical information held by hospitals and health systems—exploring the ethics concerns and public health goals of hospitals sharing these data with technology companies like Google and Amazon, drug companies, and others. The role of informed consent in data sharing, whether patients have a duty to share medical information to benefit others, the ethics of paying people for their data, and whether data should be considered a public good are discussed. The second part centers on pharmaceutical industry data—discussing concerns around demographic inclusion and representation in clinical trial data; the ethics of providing patients access to experimental medicines (with limited efficacy data) outside of trials, particularly during pandemics; whether drug companies have a duty to advance seemingly unprofitable (or less profitable) but medically promising drugs, by sharing data; and companies’ post-trial responsibilities for access to medicines from a population health perspective. We wrap up the course exploring the role of venture philanthropy by patient groups in generating clinical trial data and advancing drug development. This includes a discussion on conflicts of interest. The course is intended primarily for M.P.H. students but is open to all Yale students, including undergraduates."

"ENGL 3111 - Literary Skills Intensive": {
	Professor: Joseph North
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Most literature courses put the spotlight on specific works of literature. This course instead turns the spotlight on the capabilities we can learn by reading literature. If you love the books on your literature courses, but would like a bit more clarity about what exactly you are meant to be learning from those books, then this is the course for you. In this course we tour and practice some of the key capabilities literary education seeks to cultivate. These include (among many others!) the ability to imagine the minds and lives of other people; the ability to feel (i.e. not just think) deeply and precisely; the ability to reflect sophisticatedly on questions of value as distinct from questions of fact; the ability to use your practical life experience to help you hear the full implications of someone’s tone; the ability to listen so deeply to someone’s language that you hear almost everything they are trying to tell you, and maybe even a bit more. We enumerate these capabilities, find articulate ways to discuss them, and – most of all – we train them repeatedly via practical classroom exercises. On the way, we will have a lot of thoughtful fun."

"ARCH 3115 - The Physiologies of Modern Architecture": {
	Professor: No professor
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This seminar explores architectural histories and theories related to human physiology from the late nineteenth century to the present. Our explorations extend from nineteenth-century theories of architecture style and human physiognomy to recent discussions of immunology and architecture. Concepts of human physiology inform a broad spectrum of architectural discourses: the design and management of buildings and urban spaces; theories of architectural form and environment; and, most provocatively, the writing of architecture history itself. Physiological concepts in architecture are far from neutral: They intersect with pseudo-scientific racial and eugenic theories, debates on gender and sexuality, and evolving concepts of physical capacity, impairment, and disability. Our goal is to understand how architects, historians, and theorists have shaped and responded to conceptions of human-ness, environment, health, and physical capacity within their practices. Participants in this seminar are expected to complete weekly readings, complete a few weekly assignments, lead or co-lead one discussion, and complete a final research project."

"ENV 582 - Natural Climate Solutions in Agricultural landscapes: Topics in Enhanced Rock Weathering": {
	Professor: Maya Almaraz
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "Seminar Series: Climate change has already dramatically altered the world and without appropriate mitigation efforts, these catastrophic disruptions will continue to grow, wreaking havoc on people and the planet. It is now clear that to combat climate change we will need to both reduce emissions and remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. One such carbon dioxide removal technology that has gained traction in recent years is called enhanced rock weathering. Silicate rock weathering is a natural process that controls the earth’s climate on geologic timescales. Enhanced rock weathering involves pulverizing silicate rocks into dust and spreading dust on soils with the aim of accelerating the rate of weathering and subsequent carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere. The most promising context for deployment of enhanced rock weathering is in already highly managed and disturbed agricultural soils where it has the potential to benefit soil and crops in a diversity of ways. Despite the promise of enhanced rock weathering, there are still a myriad of unknowns when it comes to this practice and there are challenges related balancing the speed of deployment and the speed of the science."

"ENV 620 - History of Environmental Thought and Activism": {
	Professor: Dorceta Taylor
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This course uses a race, class, and gender approach to examine the history of American environmental ideology and activism from the 1600s to the present. The course is divided into three units. The first unit examines environmental conditions in the city (health, sanitation, housing, overcrowding, occupational safety, and open space), the rise of urban American environmental consciousness, and activism related to urban issues. Unit II examines the rise of the conservation and preservation movements. It analyzes the relationship between hunting, wildlife extinction, and the rise of conservation ethics. This unit also examines the role of the countryside, frontier, and wilderness in environmental thought and activism. It examines conquest, conservation, primitivism, Transcendentalism, and Romanticism and the emergence of the preservation/conservation movement. Unit III focuses on contemporary environmental thought; it examines the birth of the modern environmental movement and the emergence of reform environmentalism. The course also examines the way in which a person’s social class, race, gender, environmental, and labor market experiences influence their environmental perceptions and the kinds of environmental ideologies they develop. The course examines the rise of major environmental paradigms and the factors that make them influential."

"ENV 697 - Science for Policy and Practice: A Seminar": {
	Professor: Mark Bradford
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "Synthesizing science for policy and practice commonly requires synthesis of scientific evidence to address a targeted policy or practice question. This seminar focuses on a topical policy/practice need. This semester, the seminar focuses on synthesizing available science and protocols focused on quantifying the climate benefits of afforestation, reforestation and tree planting initiatives, with a particular focus on developing evidence that builds confidence in carbon accounting within Scope 3 emissions inventories. The course draws upon materials ranging from the IPCC GHG Inventory Guidelines—for calculating nationally determined contributions—to afforestation/reforestation protocols for carbon markets to the GHG Protocol aimed at corporations, cities and communities. We focus on discovering and unpacking the science that informs guideline/protocol development, the causal claims made, and what approaches/information might be needed to build confidence in the rigor of the claims made about reductions in GHG emissions/ enhanced removals due to activities that increase tree/forest cover. The class deliverable is an informational brief focused on the state of accounting for these activities, the degree of confidence one should have in current approaches, and what science might be needed to increase standards of evidence. This course is targeted toward students in the YSE Master’s programs, and admittance to the course is capped at twelve, requiring an application for consideration."

"ENV 774 - “Framing” Climate Migration: Science, Policy, Ethics, and Politics of a Growing Crisis": {
	Professor: Michel Gelobter
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "People have constantly moved throughout history in response to changing climates, natural disasters, and environmental degradation, usually leading to the formation of new states, the expansion of territories, and the creation of diverse economies. These migrations have historically been a way to adapt to changing environments and embrace new opportunities for growth and survival. The reality of climatic change today is of a different magnitude and consequence, occurring in a politically, economically, and socially labyrinthine and polarized world. This intensive seminar is for students from diverse disciplines and offers students an option for summer field work to allow for a deeper understanding of climate migration. This course explores the complex relationship between climate change and migration, focusing on the attribution of environmental/climate change drivers, the experiences of migrants, the responses of host communities, and the rise of a far-right negative narrative on climate migration. Legal frameworks and human rights perspectives are central to understanding the challenges and opportunities for climate migrants."

"ENV 791 - Climate Adaptation": {
	Professor: No professor
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "Are we prepared for climate change? As climate extremes intensify and new normals emerge, communities, governments, and businesses are adjusting and increasing resilience, to support safety, well-being, and markets. Yet these efforts are far from sufficient for the present, much less the future—and they have not benefited all people and regions equally. This course tackles key challenges in climate adaptation. But what is adaptation? And how well are those adaptations working—and for whom? What are options and approaches for improving climate preparedness? This class equips students to create solutions for these key adaptation themes: the intersectional complexity of climate risks and responses; risk and policy assessment, including  decision-making under deep uncertainty methods; monitoring, evaluation, and learning in adaptation; equity and justice in adaptation processes and outcomes; governance (local-to-international, across the public and private sectors and civil society); risk sharing and transfer, including insurance and systemic risks; and pathways for transformational adjustments. Students integrate theories and empirical insights across disciplines. They explore and create adaptation solutions for the thorny real-world contexts increasingly affected by climate today."

"ENV 794 - Climate Ethics: Principles and Model Applications": {
	Professor: Narasimha Rao
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This 1.5-credit graduate-level course delves into the literature in philosophy, welfare economics and integrated assessment modeling to provide students with an overview of how climate change has been viewed as a moral phenomenon that raises claims for differentiating action while acknowledging the common threat to humanity. The course examines philosophical principles, modeling studies that examine countries’ obligations under different principles, and their treatment in international agreements and politics. Students learn primarily through writing assignments, class discussions, and simple manipulation of models in problem sets. Basic knowledge of climate science is expected."

"ARCH 3012 - Architecture and Modernity: Sites and Spaces": {
	Professor: No professor
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "(Required of first-year M.Arch. I and M.E.D. students; available as an elective for M.Arch. II students.) This course seeks to question modern architecture and historiography through the lenses of both colonialism and decoloniality. Colonialism and the power structures that sustained it have deeply affected architecture across the globe and left a pervasive mark on the histories of architecture in use to this day. At the same time, forceful and resilient counter-cultures emerged throughout colonized, and later postcolonial, nations which engendered extraordinary architecture and critically aware historiographies that continually challenge the universalist pretensions of western modernity. Our agenda is a historiography that does not speak from the center alone but from the "margins" as well---a diverse, inclusive account that rejects hegemonic narratives and practices. Deconstructing binaries, it engages in self-reflexive critique, works to pluralize authorship, and brings analytical rigor to bear on its main task: to uncover the persistence of Euro-centered modes in the production of architectural knowledge even in the supposedly postcolonial present; and to suggest other interpretive models."

This is an introductory course focusing on the literature, culture, and material artifacts of eastern Mediterranean communities from c.500 BCE-400 CE. Investigating these sources, we ask: How have the scholarly and popular categories of medicine, magic, and miracle aided or obscured our understanding of approaches to the divine, to ritual, to health, and to the human body? Should we parse these categories, and did the ancient individuals who used to lived in the eastern Mediterranean? There is special focus on stories of the miracles of Jesus and apostles, the cult of Asclepius, Hippocratic Greek medicine, the phenomenon of curse tablets and incantations in the ancient world, and non-normate ("disabled") bodies in antiquity, including those who identified as women. The course includes time with Greco-Egyptian amulets in the Yale Babylonian collection and amulets/curses in lead and on papyri at the Beinecke Library."

"ARCH 3075 - A Land Reparations Network": {
	Professor: Keller Easterling
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "With support from Yale’s ASCEND initiative, this seminar shares sessions with Morgan State and other HBCUs to explore precedents and potentials for land reparations in the U.S. The ownership of land as property has been a central mechanism for generating staggering wealth inequality. The seminar considers a broader history of mutualism, care, maintenance, and kinship that are at the heart of Indigenous, Black, abolitionist, feminist, and anarchist thinking. It pays particular attention to an underexplored, 150-year tradition of Black land cooperatives—from reconstruction to the civil rights era to today. Generating community economies that avoid the automatic harm of financial abstractions, cooperative land holding organs are treated as spatial infrastructures as worthy of public investment as those of concrete and conduit with compounding values that can begin to address the incalculable debt of reparations. Considering reparations and climate change as inseparable, the seminar also studies solidarities to deal with climate injustice at a planetary scale. Guest speakers, shared between MSU and YSOA, strengthen a consortium of HBCUs and prepare to pursue design studios at the northern and southern ends of a proposed spine of existing public land called the ATTTNT. The ATTTNT is created from the Appalachian Trail (AT), the water route of the Trail of Tears (TT) on TVA land, and the Natchez Trace Parkway (NT). Continuous from Maine to the Mississippi, this three-thousand-mile linear formation, often scripted by narratives of white supremacy, here receives another reckoning with the under-told histories of Black and Indigenous resistance and survival."

	Description: "This global introductory course broadly surveys the relationship between art and technology from parietal art (the art of prehistoric caves and rock art) to the rise of NFTs ("non-fungible tokens") within contemporary digital culture. Departing from the notion of "techne" as craftsmanship or art, we consider the ways in which the history of art is always informed by histories of technology; and that histories of technology are often advanced through practices of art making. Topics include technologies for representing space in European and Asian painting and the centrality of Arab science in the development of linear perspective during the Renaissance; histories of textiles as data storage before the advent of the computer; the cybernetic revolution and the rise of computers; biometrics and surveillance; machine learning and art without artists. Objects include textiles, sculpture, painting, prints, photography and video, as well as sound, digital platforms and AI-generated artifacts. The course aims to de-center triumphal and universalist notions of technological achievement and ideologies of "progress" that inform contemporary cultures of media and technology. We pay special attention to the interests of race and gender throughout the semester. This course is open to all, including those with no prior background in art history. Sections may include visits to collections and sites across Yale campus."

"ARCG 170 - Art and Architecture of the Roman Empire": {
	Professor: No professor
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "The Roman Empire stretched from Spain to Syria, Scotland to the Sahara. This course treats the architecture, painting, and sculpture from this vast geographical area thematically. The Roman world encompassed many different cultures and traditions, but exhibits shared elements in artistic and architectural production across the empire. These points of contact, and the reasons behind them, will be explored through a thematic approach which looks across geographies in every session, comparing monuments and artworks on the basis of their functions. Students are asked to engage with key works in the history of Roman Art, but also are exposed to objects from beyond the canon that reorient our focus on understudied elements of ‘Roman Art’. Some readings introduce students to the material under discussion, while more focused scholarly texts offer insight into recent research in the field. This course is intended for those with an interest in the ancient world or in art history, but no specific disciplinary knowledge or prior coursework is required."

	Description: "In the second semester of Portuguese, students continue to deepen their understanding of the language and cultures of the Luso-Brazilian and Lusophone Africa worlds by engaging with interdisciplinary themes. Instead of traditional textbooks, students explore diverse authentic materials. This course invites students to explore lugares da memória (places of memory) to analyze how subjectivity is shaped by the spaces we inhabit and how modern transformations of these places impact our relationship with the environment. Organized into four content units, "What is Culture?", "Anti-Touristic Guide", "Displacement of Memories", and "Ludic Spaces", students create a variety of projects (clips, podcasts, story maps, video essay, puppet theater) that explore the interplay between language and culture, our perception and connection with cities and sites of diasporic memory, food as historical and cultural heritage, and the loss of playfulness in adulthood. The course engages students through a variety of genres and paced activities focused on comprehension, contextualization, reflection, and creation of new meaning. By the end of this course, students have developed an understanding of the language and cultures across various textual genres and gained deeper insights into multiple aspects of Portuguese-speaking world.

"AMST 050 - Reading Poetry for Life": {
	Professor: Jim Berger
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This is a course about reading poetry–about how to read poetry. It is also a course about how reading poetry helps us live, and especially in a world of multiple zones of crisis, violence, injustice, and environmental degradation. Thus, the course’s goals are intellectual, aesthetic, emotional, and ethical. True engagement with poetry is an engagement of the whole person. The course is organized thematically: There are units on poetic responses to war and social injustice; on personal pain and transformation; on poetry of happiness; and on poems that just enjoy their own formal processes. Poetry can say powerfully–sometimes directly, sometimes obliquely–what may be difficult to express in other forms. And yet, we must ask also, what good does it do? It helps us feel? It helps us think? It helps us feel and think with others? Poetry is a very old form of linguistic expression, perhaps the oldest. Here we are, still writing and reading it. And the sufferings, crimes, and hopes it has always imagined still are happening. Here we are. Maybe poetry is our best attempt at honesty, as simple and complex as that is. Previously ENGL 050."

"ENV 767 - Tools for Conservation Project Design and Management": {
	Professor: Amy Vedder
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "As wildlife and wildland conservation programs have multiplied and grown in size, conservation organizations have sought methods to improve strategic project planning, assessment of progress, cross-project comparison, learning of lessons, and transparency for donors. To address these challenges, major nonprofit organizations have collaboratively designed a set of decision-support tools for planning field projects and programs and for monitoring their progress, summarized in the "Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation" (http://cmp-openstandards.org). Use of these tools has allowed organizations to more clearly articulate strategies, define priority actions, critically assess success, manage adaptively, and derive lessons—all of which help to improve effectiveness. Students in this course explore a mutually reinforcing suite of these project tools: their underlying principles are introduced, students practice the techniques, and current case studies from field conservation are examined to explore tool utility. Students synthesize use of these design tools in a final project design focused on a single case study of their choice. The suite of decision-support tools covered includes situation (logic) models for project design, stakeholder assessments, threats and opportunities analysis, conservation target identification, and monitoring frameworks. Students gain experience in design of projects and their monitoring, as well as familiarity with budgeting. Evaluation is based on class participation, regular assignments, and a final project design paper."

	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This course will require active participation in class. Please be prepared and committed to engage in class. If you do not enjoy contributing in class, this might not be the right course for you. Using the Socratic case method, this course will explore several of the many ways to be an entrepreneur. MBA students frequently express interest in doing something entrepreneurial after completing their graduate degree program. Most MBA students with an interest in entrepreneurship consider only a narrow range of potential business opportunities. This course will highlight the multiple ways to become an entrepreneur. Entrepreneurship, using HBS Professor Howard Stevenson’s definition of "pursuing an opportunity beyond the resources controlled," is a big tent. Although Silicon Valley technology ventures and flashy consumer products startups receive most of the attention in the media and on campus, there are other ways to jump into the entrepreneurial arena. This course explores six distinct patterns in entrepreneurship (and there might be many more), some of which fly under the radar of many MBA students. This course will not advocate any single pattern of entrepreneurship over the others; rather, the course will encourage students to discover the best potential path for themselves using a ten-step framework for analysis. There is no right or wrong pattern in entrepreneurship – aspiring entrepreneurs owe it to themselves to learn about and contemplate a variety of options. Then, with better information and a higher degree of confidence, they can rigorously evaluate which entrepreneurial path best suits their specific interests, needs, and goals. Additionally, aspiring entrepreneurs should factor risk and lifestyle into their decision-making process. Which form of entrepreneurship has the highest probability of success, however you define it? And which one will best accommodate the lifestyle you envision for yourself? Official and unofficial auditing is not permitted.

	Professor: John Williams
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course offers a survey of literary and cinematic representations of Asia and Asian America by a number of highly influential Euro- and Asian-American authors and filmmakers in the twentieth century. Unlike more traditional survey of American orientalism that deal exclusively with white American images of the East, this course examines the notion that Asian Americans contributed in significant ways to the representation of Asia and Asian America in the American imagination, often appropriating and re-purposing stereotypical images to secure a more positive space in the American cultural landscape. Our readings and discussions consider the extent to which the "Asia" that emerges in twentieth-century American literary and visual culture was a product of not only powerful (and often powerfully racist) Euro-American visions of Asian "others," but also dialogic re-imaginations of Asia created by Asian-Americans themselves. Questions that the course addresses include: In what sense is "Asia" an aesthetic category in American literary and visual culture? What role does genre play in the circulation and recirculation of American images of Asia during the twentieth century? How do the political and economic demands of artistic production (for both literature and film) influence the type and heterogeneity of American images of Asia?"

	Professor: Greg Ellermann
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course is dedicated to one of the greatest, and most challenging, works of modern philosophy: Immanuel Kant’s Critique of Judgment. Published in 1790, at the start of the revolutionary ferment in France, Kant’s Critique announced a revolution of its own: the book develops a bold new picture of the human being with its innate capacities for knowledge, freedom, and pleasure. Starting from the traditional philosophical category of judgment, the Critique sets out to explore the surprising intimacies among the human mind, works of art, and living nature. Along the way, it offers generative accounts of beauty, the sublime, imagination, taste, organic form, and more. The book ends with a meditation on moral progress, reflecting on the purpose of history itself. Alongside Kant’s Critique, we read the work of some important philosophical precursors, including David Hume and Alexander Baumgarten. In the final weeks, we turn to Hannah Arendt’s lectures on Kant, which present the Critique as a rich and unfamiliar source for a new thinking of the political."

"ENGL 3412 - Writing About Faith": {
	Professor: Danielle Chapman
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Writing about Faith takes on the challenge of articulating spiritual reality, and the quest toward it, at a time when hunger for meaning at its height, yet shared religious language is often fraught or nonexistent. Students will discover how contemporary writers in various genres— nonfiction, poetry, and fiction— dramatize encounters with God and God’s absence, and students will write their own work based on prompts from the reading. We will explore three major phases of the spiritual quest, "Attentiveness," "Devotion/Vocation," and "Revelation/Redemption." In both our reading and writing, we will search for compelling, authentic expressions of ideas and experiences that are often considered "untranslatable." We will read primarily American writers, with examples from different religions and cultures, alongside atheist and agnostic authors interested in ultimate meanings. Each week, readings will be paired with writing prompts, and at the end of each of the three thematic units, students will submit a piece of writing in one of the three genres we explore. At the end of the course, students will submit a culminating work in the genre of their choice."

"CSDC 220 - The Psychology and Ethics of Persuasion": {
	Professor: Peter Wicks
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Learning about the psychology of persuasion can help us to become more effective speakers and writers, but it should also lead us to ask important questions: How can we avoid being misled by the various forms of psychological influence to which we are all susceptible? Where should we draw the line between legitimate techniques of persuasion and unethical manipulation? What practical steps can we take to make our arguments about politics and other contentious topics more constructive and less acrimonious? This interdisciplinary course is intended to help you to develop a better understanding of the psychological and ethical complexities of persuasion, but its primary goal is practical: to help you develop skills and habits that will enable you to be an effective and ethical persuader while also learning to recognize and resist common tactics of manipulation."

From the slave ship to the spaceship, from the plantation complex and along the underground railroad, from the kitchenette of Chicago, the Harlem airshaft and the rooftop, to the mountains and bayous of maroon communities, we consider spaces both conceptual and material, spaces of incarceration and liberation, routes of migration, cartographies of fugitivity, and patterns of flight. Like black study and black cultural production in the Americas, "black geographies" must be understood as always operating in what artist Xaviera Simmons has called "a feedback loop":  the Middle Passage wraps back around like a Mobius strip, reconstituted as the site of an imagined black Atlantis. Anxieties about the inhuman status of the black body torque against time, giving way to utopian visions where "space is the place," where the galactic is figured as both a destination and a place of origin. Thus, we must examine and trouble these circulations of space and time in ways that can account for their multiple meanings and varying mobilizations. Reading works by Langston Hughes, Gwendolyn Brooks, Toni Morrison, and more, we think deeply and widely about black space and place."

"AFAM 322 - Coming of Age in Black Literature": {
	Professor: Sarah Mahurin
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Phillip Atiba Goff’s 2014 study "The Essence of Innocence" confirmed that Black children are widely perceived as older than they actually are, and are presumed to be less innocent than their white classmates–often with devastating consequences. This course aims to challenge the "systematic adultification" so prevalent in American (mis)understandings of Black youth by centering narratives of Black childhood across literary genres. How do these texts disrupt conventional approaches to the bildungsroman, and what can these writers teach us about coming of age in America? Previously ENGL 360."

"AFAM 362 - Black France": {
	Professor: Marlene Daut
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course offers an in-depth exploration of the complex history of Black France, tracing its roots from the era of French colonization in the Caribbean and the transatlantic slave trade to its contemporary manifestations across France and its overseas territories. Beginning with an examination of French colonialism in the Caribbean, particularly focusing on the brutal system of slavery and the development of the Code Noir under the reign of Louis XIV, students gain a comprehensive understanding of the origins of race-thinking in France. Students also read about the pivotal role of French colonies like Saint-Domingue, Martinique, and Guadéloupe in the resistance against slavery, highlighting the Haitian Revolution as a watershed moment in the struggle for freedom and self-determination. Through the lens of this historic event, students analyze the complexities of slave rebellion, the quest for abolition, and the enduring legacy of resistance in Black (francophone) communities. By highlighting the socio-political relationship of the colonial and revolutionary era to the present, students explore the interconnectedness of slavery, colonialism, and power dynamics within the French empire and the enduring impact of this tumultuous history on contemporary conceptions of Blackness in France. Using an interdisciplinary approach that encompasses history, sociology, literary, and cultural studies, students analyze the formation of Black identity, racial ideologies, and the ongoing struggle for recognition and equality within French society."

These are some of the questions that inspired the creation of this course. In this seminar, students explore theoretical feminist, Black feminist, and Crip-of-Color perspectives of care work as well as experiential healing modalities that might interrupt cycles of harm often experienced by care workers."

"AFST 200 - Social Dimensions of Evolution in Africa": {
	Professor: Veronica Waweru
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Africa as the cradle of humanity is a widely accepted theory in scientific studies. Elsewhere nationalist archaeology has been used to bolster nationalism and facilitate state building. Africans, while embracing their recent history, have a marked disconnect to the cradle paradigm. A paradox thus arises out of the fact that the cradle of humanity status of Africa appears to hold no special place in the psyche of most of its inhabitants. This course examines symbolism, colonialism, poverty, media, literacy, and religion as agencies that distance the ‘humanity cradle’ status of Africa from nationalist and identity discourses."

"AMST 032 - Gender, Sexuality, and U.S. Empire": {
	Professor: No professor
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course explores the cultural history of America’s relationship to the world across the long twentieth century with particular attention to the significance of gender, sexuality, and race. We locate U.S. culture and politics within an international dynamic, exposing the interrelatedness of domestic and foreign affairs. While exploring specific geopolitical events like the Spanish-American War, World War I and II, and the Cold War, this course emphasizes the political importance of culture and ideology rather than offering a formal overview of U.S. foreign policy. How have Americans across the twentieth century drawn from ideas about gender to understand their country’s relationship to the wider world? In what ways have gendered ideologies and gendered approaches to politics shaped America’s performance on the world’s stage? How have geopolitical events impacted the construction of race and gender on the home front? In the most general sense, this course is designed to encourage students to understand American cultural and gender history as the product of America’s engagement with the world. In so doing, we explore the rise of U.S. global power as an enterprise deeply related to conceptions of race, sexuality, and gender. We also examine films, political speeches, visual culture, music, and popular culture."

"AMST 200 - Topics in Human Sexuality": {
	Professor: Joseph Fischel
	Credits: 1
	Description: "In 1970, Yale professors and sexuality scholars Lorna and Philip Sarrel introduced what came to be their wildly popular lecture, "Topics in Human Sexuality." The course, offered at the height of the sexual revolution and shortly after Yale University admitted women undergraduates, was multipurpose: to teach students about pressing, contemporary social problems around sex, gender, and sexuality; to help students learn about their bodies, sexualities, and relationships; to direct students to resources and information about their sexual and reproductive health; and to advance the mission of a liberal arts education, namely, the cultivation of well-rounded, critically engaged, curious, participatory young citizens. This iteration of the course is inspired by the Sarrels’ ambitions, even if we are unlikely to realize them in full. The course is offered in the spirit of a critical sexuality education, critical as in 1) theory- rather than practicum-driven, but nonetheless 2) urgent. As political movements that endanger transgender children, suppress sexual expression, and rescind reproductive rights gain traction, the course offers candid, careful focus on: abortion, sexual education, queer and trans kids, pornography, university sexual politics, hooking up, and breaking up.  Along the way, we watch a season of Netlfix’s "Sex Education" together. The class (nonexclusively) focuses on social and political problems in the contemporary United States, and examines those problems by drawing upon scholarship in Gender & Sexuality Studies, American Studies, Sociology, Psychology, and Public Law."

	Description: "In 1970, Yale professors and sexuality scholars Lorna and Philip Sarrel introduced what came to be their wildly popular lecture, "Topics in Human Sexuality." The course, offered at the height of the sexual revolution and shortly after Yale University admitted women undergraduates, was multipurpose: to teach students about pressing, contemporary social problems around sex, gender, and sexuality; to help students learn about their bodies, sexualities, and relationships; to direct students to resources and information about their sexual and reproductive health; and to advance the mission of a liberal arts education, namely, the cultivation of well-rounded, critically engaged, curious, participatory young citizens. This iteration of the course is inspired by the Sarrels’ ambitions, even if we are unlikely to realize them in full. The course is offered in the spirit of a critical sexuality education, critical as in 1) theory- rather than practicum-driven, but nonetheless 2) urgent. As political movements that endanger transgender children, suppress sexual expression, and rescind reproductive rights gain traction, the course offers candid, careful focus on: abortion, sexual education, queer and trans kids, pornography, university sexual politics, hooking up, and breaking up.  Along the way, we watch a season of Netlfix’s "Sex Education" together. The class (nonexclusively) focuses on social and political problems in the contemporary United States, and examines those problems by drawing upon scholarship in Gender & Sexuality Studies, American Studies, Sociology, Psychology, and Public Law."

"AMST 206 - Introduction to Critical Refugee Studies": {
	Professor: Quan Tran
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Reconfiguring refugees as fluid subjects and sites of social, political, and cultural critiques.

"AMST 223 - Advanced Dance Repertory": {
	Professor: Renee Robinson
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Advanced Dance Repertory is offered to advanced students in dance who wish to deepen their technical abilities and broaden their exposure to a range of choreographic visions and styles. The course combines movement practice with an in-depth study of an artist's historical import. This year's studio intensive explores Alvin Ailey’s unique craft as a choreographer and master storyteller, with a focus on his lesser-known relationship to jazz and the music of Duke Ellington. Ailey created a company that both celebrated the African American experience and preserved and advanced the modern dance tradition. Students  encounter these ideas through learning excerpts of Ailey’s master works. The course covers a full reconstruction of Mr. Ailey’s dance "Night Creature" (1975), with excerpts folded in from "The River" (1971/1980), both with music by Ellington, and his seminal work "Revelations" (1960), among other choreographies. We also attend to Ailey's influence on younger choreographers, in the work of Ron Brown and Jamar Roberts. The semester culminates in an invited studio showing."

"AMST 290 - Documenting Sound": {
	Professor: Ryan Brasseaux
	Credits: 1
	Description: "An invisible world envelops us. Acoustic waves, vibrations, frequencies, and rhythms shape our perceptions. They stir our emotions. Soundscapes orient us to space and geography. Meanwhile, voices and the stories they tell can transport us, comfort us, provoke us, enrage us. In short, sound connects us and divides us. The sonic world shapes our lives in ways we take for granted. That is, until we listen and create meaning around what we hear. Documenting Sound is an interdisciplinary and experiential seminar that examines aurality as both primary source and as a democratizing communication mode. The course delves into academic studies focusing on sound generated in American Studies, sound and media studies, social science, folklore, among other disciplines. Students will not only be reading about sound, but they’ll be working directly in the aural medium. The course is divided into four units: Listening; Recording Sound; Producing Sound; and Disseminating Sound."

"AMST 315 - Writing Anthropology: Digital Fan Communities": {
	Professor: Nala Williams
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Are you a Twihard? BTS ARMY? A Chalamaniac? This course investigates the communities and practices that emerge around popular media. In this course we think critically about fan responses to popular media through fanfiction, fanvids, shipping, and online fandoms. Through which we explore how fan responses point to and rely on the questioning and rethinking of media texts, to reinvent them as powerful but covert means of access and transformation. We examine fandoms/online fan communities as addressing the needs of marginalized communities to adapt, expand, and challenge books, movies, music, and other media to meet their needs. This course engages fan cultural practices as robust networks of critique through examinations of gender, race, sexuality, intellectual property ownership, and the production of fan labor."

}
"AMST 324 - Abolition, Anarchism, and the Good Life": {
	Professor: Roberto Sirvent
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This seminar introduces students to anarchist and abolitionist political theories and explores their implications for the study of ethics. By drawing on recent theorizations of mutual aid, we will see how practices of care, cooperation, and solidarity help people survive and mobilize communities toward collective action, all while re-imagining discourses around "the life well lived." Other topics discussed in the course include: theories and practices of collective, communal self-defense; the role of ancestral memory in providing moral guidance and grounding for revolutionary struggle; and movements to abolish work, the family, and U.S. schooling. Throughout the course, students will also examine various critiques of abolitionist and anarchist political theory, many of which come from within each respective tradition. For example, many community organizers have critiqued the co-optation and "de-radicalization" of abolitionism by academics, celebrity activists, mainstream media, and the non-profit industrial complex, while recent work in Black Studies and psychoanalysis critiques the "prefigurative" politics of many anarchist social movements. As a result, the seminar is especially relevant for anyone interested in the intersection of American Studies, political theory, and moral philosophy, and for students open to considering how abolition and anarchism can inform our moral reasoning and ethical commitments to revolutionary struggle."
}
"AMST 327 - The Cultural Politics of Sports": {
	Professor: Roberto Sirvent
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Given the Eurocentric, colonial, white supremacist, and heteropatriarchal structures of modern sport, it is no surprise that sport plays a central role in naturalizing hierarchies of bodies and producing racialized and gendered norms.  Drawing on various fields like Black Studies, queer theory, trans studies, disability studies, sport communication; media studies, critical geography, and decolonial and anti-colonial thought, this course introduces students to the gendered and sexual dynamics of sport in American culture, as well as the racialized gender policing that occurs within the world of sports.  Throughout the course, students will examine how hegemonic portrayals of masculinity structures U.S. sports’ entanglement with militarism and neoliberalism, and, more broadly, how gender and sexuality are deployed in service of colonialism, racism, and U.S. imperialism.  In addition, we will explore how amateur and professional sports aid in the formation of social classes, national and racial identities, sexuality, and gender roles in the United States. Key topics and case studies include: the rise of trans moral panics in sport; Indigenous and anti-colonial resistance to native mascots and sport "mega-events"; the politics of protest and patriotism in the sporting arena; the ways that legal, medical, and scientific discourses in global sport produce and reproduce power relations; anti-Black media representations of Simone Biles and Naomi Osaka; the racial politics of fandom; and, finally, what Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift’s relationship might teach us about U.S. celebrity culture and its relation to dominant views of race, masculinity, and femininity."

	Credits: 1
	Description: "An exploration of the times of Bob Dylan: the rhythms, tempos, and meters of his songs, and the social, political, cultural and musical histories of his times, from the 1920s to the 2010s. Topics include the blues and folk music revivals, the "new song" movements, rock music, and the transformations in the music industry; Dylan’s involvement in the civil rights and black liberation movements; his place in the experimental arts of 1960s postmodernism; his relation to the remaking of American religion; his songs of love and war in an era of sexual revolution, women’s liberation, and antiwar mobilization; the covers of his songs by musicians across styles, modes, and languages; and the overarching question of the social situations and cultural meanings of song. Along with Dylan’s songs, films, and memoir (Chronicles), we read musicologists, literary critics, cultural theorists, historians, and American studies scholars."
}
"AMST 376 - Art and the American Civil War": {
	Professor: Jennifer Raab
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The military battles of the American Civil War may have been fought between 1861 and 1865, the Emancipation Proclamation issued in 1863, but the pain, injustice, structural inequalities, and state-sponsored violence that are the legacies of chattel slavery remain. One might say that the Civil War has never really ended. This course looks not only at the visual and material culture produced during the conflict but also its far-reaching future effects. We explore the emergence of photojournalism and the illustrated newspaper; African American activism and the use of photographic portraiture; radical shifts in religious and cultural rituals surrounding death and mourning; the material culture of disability; the absence of traditional history paintings and the surge of white supremacist sculptures after Reconstruction; and how the violence and trauma of war and enslavement pose distinct ethical and representational challenges for visual media. We visit collections across campus and think about the memorialization of the war at Yale, in New Haven, and beyond."

}
"AMST 446 - Sculpture and the Human in the 20th Century": {
	Professor: Joanna Fiduccia
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course explores how sculpture responded to radical struggles over the definition of the human in the 20th century. Our focus is the decades between 1914 and 1989, an interval when competing ideas about the nature of humanity emerged from global warfare, feminist activism and theory, postcolonial nationalisms, the Civil Rights Movement, and the Non-Aligned Movement—ideas that challenged a modern vision of the human forged by the forces of whiteness, capitalism, and patriarchy. What role did sculpture play in developing this vision, and can it serve to re-imagine or dismantle it? What perspective can sculpture’s intimate relation to the body lend to a fuller understanding of the human, its problems and potentials? We explore a range of art historical, literary, and philosophical frameworks to consider works by artists including Meta Warrick Fuller, Barbara Hepworth, Louise Bourgeois, Melvin Edwards, Paul Thek, Senga Nengudi, and Atsuko Tanaka. These works act as our lens to see more clearly an interconnected set of political contests to transform humanism from an Enlightenment-era worldview built on notions of innate human nature and universal values into a flexible, evolving understanding of human difference, struggle, and solidarity. We ask what it might look like to understand a history of sculpture shaped by Aimé Césaire’s "humanism made to the measure of the world"— one that remains alive to what sculpture might tell us about being human in relation to the non-human, less than human, and natural world. This course includes visits to university art collections and archives, as well as close engagement with the international conference, "Surrogates: Embodied Histories of Sculpture in the Short 20th-Century," which will be held at Yale during the fall semester."

"AMST 459 - Multispecies Worlds": {
	Professor: Kathryn Dudley
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This seminar explores the relational and material worlds that humans create in concert with other-than-human species. Through an interdisciplinary analysis of the problematic subject of anthropology—Anthropos—we seek to pose new questions about the fate of life worlds in the present epoch of anthropogenic climate change. Our readings track circuits of knowledge from anthropology and philosophy to geological history, literary criticism, and environmental studies as we come to terms with the loss of biodiversity, impending wildlife extinctions, and political-economic havoc wrought by global warming associated with the Anthropocene.  A persistent provocation guides our inquiry: What multispecies worldings become possible to recognize and cultivate when we dare to decenter the human in our politics, passions, and aspirations for life on a shared planet?"

"ANTH 307 - Reparation, Repair, Reconciliation: Reckoning with Slavery and Colonialism in Global Perspective": {
	Professor: Yukiko Koga
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Imperial reckoning for slavery, imperialism, and colonialism has gained new momentum in recent years, from official apologies for colonial violence to reparations lawsuits filed in Asia, Europe, and the US for slavery, genocide, and massacres, to demands for the return of bodily remains and cultural artifacts from established cultural institutions. This seminar explores how these new attempts for belated imperial reckoning are reshaping relations between former empires and their ex-colonies. It approaches imperial reckoning as a site for redressing not only the original violence but also the transitional injustice incurred in the process of the unmaking of empire, which calls for post-imperial reckoning. Drawing on examples from recent cases, this course explores what it means to belatedly reckon with imperial violence today. What does it mean to reckon with imperial violence through legal means, decades after the dissolution of empires? What is the role of law in belated redress? How is historical responsibility articulated and by whom? Who is responsible for what, then and now? What are the stakes in reckoning with distant, yet still alive, pasts? Why and how does it matter today for those of us who have no direct experience of imperial violence? This course approaches these questions through an anthropological exploration of concepts such as debt, gift, moral economy, structural violence, complicity and implication, and abandonment."

"ANTH 308 - Feminist & Queer Ethnographies: Borders and Boundaries": {
	Professor: Eda Pepi
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This seminar gives students a storm’s eye view of contemporary crises, where borders are as volatile as the ring of a wedding bell or the birth of a child. Feminist and queer ethnographies explore the geopolitical lines and social divides that define and confine us. Manifesting through laws, social norms, and physical barriers, borders and boundaries shape our identities, turning the intimate act of living into a fiercely political one. We consider them as lived experiences that cross militarized lines—as the everyday realities of families, detention centers, workplaces, universities, and even nightclubs. Our readings trace the fluidity of borders, the extension of the global north's influence, and the internal colonialism that redraws the landscapes of nations. Contemporary ways of bridging time and space are profoundly gendered, sexualized racialized, and class-specific, capable of materializing with sudden intensity for some and remaining imperceptible to others, morphing from ephemeral lines to seemingly permanent barriers. The course is an invitation to think beyond the map – to understand borders as something people live, challenge, and transform. Our intellectual battleground is the liminal space where geopolitics meets the raw human struggle for recognition, peeling back the layers of political theatre to witness the making and unmaking of our borderlands. Anchored by a "radical hope for living otherwise," the seminar also aims to expand the intellectual horizons necessary for dreaming of, and working towards, the world to come."

"ANTH 318 - Peril and Possibility in the South Asian City": {
	Professor: Kalyanakrishnan Sivaramakrishnan
	Credits: 1
	Description: "For the first time in human history, at some point in the last decade a majority of humankind became city dwellers. A fifth of these city-dwelling masses inhabit the massive and massifying megacities of the Indian sub-continent. Karachi, Dhaka, and Bombay frequently threaten to be the most populous urban centers on earth, and it may only be faith in the accuracy of government census data that defers this dubious honor. For while these cities are plugged into the global flows of people, ideas, things, and capital; such developments also bring with them anomie, alienation, dispossession, and depredations. Historical social conflicts born of a century of European colonialism and millennia of caste society have in some cases been mitigated, in others intensified in ways both insidious and invidious. Much ink has been spilt on contouring both the perils and possibilities attending the urbanization of the sub-continent. This course explores a ground-up view of the many ways in which the urban denizens of these bustling cities where pasts and futures collide, experience this collision. While this course draws on interdisciplinary scholarly examinations engaging the urban emergent, it focuses on the realm of experience, desire and affect germinating in the city. Students sample ethnography, art, speculative fiction, and film to map out the textures of this complex and mutating fabric. In doing so we chart the emergence and application of new ideas and cultures, practices and constraints, identities and conflicts in the contemporary urban landscapes."

	Professor: Claudia Valeggia
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course is not your regular lecture or seminar class. It is indeed a journey, an exploration of female bodies from an evolutionary and biosocial perspective. We focus on physiological, ecological, and social aspects of women’s development from puberty, through reproductive processes such as menstrual cycles, pregnancy, birth, postpartum and breastfeeding, and menopause. We also explore variation in female life histories in a variety of western and non-western cultural and ecological settings. Examples are drawn primarily from traditional and modern human societies and our own life experiences. We encourage critical thinking at all times with the hope that discussions in this class become useful when making decisions about your lives as citizens, potential parents, health care providers, health care recipients, and policy makers. This course is taught entirely in Spanish."

"ANTH 356 - Goods and Goodness": {
	Professor: Jane Lynch
	Credits: 1
	Description: "What is the good in buying organic milk or a shirt stitched with a "Made in USA" tag? Should people try to effect social, economic, and environmental change through their purchasing habits? This course examines "ethical consumerism" by tracing its antecedents and placing them in social, cultural, and historical contexts. We ask: how do different ideas of what makes goods good affect what we make and buy, give and take, keep as treasure and toss out as trash? To address this question, we investigate the moral claims that have been central in debates over what the economy is. Readings for this course provide students with a grounding in classic theories of political economy. However, we also examine scholarship that challenges and encourages us to read against the grain of those theories. Drawing upon this latter body of scholarship, we explore how "ethical consumerism" intersects with nationalist projects, socioeconomic privilege, race and racialization, religious values, and the gendering of consumer behaviors and identities. Our study of commodities in this course is thus an inquiry into diverse claims about "goodness" and the ways in which ethics and morality both intersect with and are embedded in economic life."

"ANTH 373 - Water and Society: Culture, Life, and Values": {
	Professor: Lav Kanoi
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Water has become an urgent theme not just in current anthropology, but in development studies and environmental studies more generally. Beyond questions of scarcity and sustainability, water allows human life to flourish, and without water, there would be no civilization. Yet water is not equitably distributed across time or space, leading to contestation and conflict around water. Against such a background of strife, this course examines how human beings have related to water, to other life forms, and to each other through the control of water, in different historical moments and different parts of the world. The seminar is organized around four porous thematic clusters: (i) "urban water", to do with cities and urban industrial life; (ii) "agrarian water", to do with rivers, irrigation systems, and agrarian life; (iii) "rural water", to do with coasts, lakes, dams and rural life; and (iv) and "living water", to do with social, cultural and political values, and human and more-than-human life. This seminar introduces students to the everyday values of water, as well as the everyday politics of water, including the production of water and its attendant politics at the level of the nation-state as well as the city municipality while also being attentive to the moral ecologies of water. By studying water in different ways through the lens of culture, environment, social justice, and spirituality or faith, students develop a nuanced understanding of development, urbanization, environmental justice, and climate change."

}
"ANTH 383 - In Ordinary Fashion": {
	Professor: Jane Lynch
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Clothing fashions not only our bodies but also our experiences in and claims about the world. It has been used to define the nature and radical possibilities of indigeneity, anti-colonial nationalism, counter-cultural narratives, and capitalist critiques. At the same time, dress–and its social and legal regulation–also creates and reinforces social hierarchies, systems of morality, and forms of exclusion. This course centers these competing social realities and histories using clothing as a way into understanding the poetics and politics of everyday life. Readings include ethnographies and social histories of textiles, fashion, and the manufacture of garments including cases from India, Guatemala, Italy, China, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Trinidad, and the United States."

"ANTH 415 - Culture, History, Power, and Representation": {
	Professor: Helen Siu
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This seminar critically explores how anthropologists use contemporary social theories to formulate the junctures of meaning, interest, and power. It thus aims to integrate symbolic, economic, and political perspectives on culture and social process. If culture refers to the understandings and meanings by which people live, then it constitutes the conventions of social life that are themselves produced in the flux of social life, invented by human activity. Theories of culture must therefore illuminate this problematic of agency and structure. They must show how social action can both reproduce and transform the structures of meaning, the conventions of social life. Even as such a position becomes orthodox in anthropology, it raises serious questions about the possibilities for ethnographic practice and theoretical analysis. How, for example, are such conventions generated and transformed where there are wide differentials of power and unequal access to resources? What becomes of our notions of humans as active agents of culture when the possibilities for maneuver and the margin of action for many are overwhelmed by the constraints of a few? How do elites—ritual elders, Brahmanic priests, manorial lords, factory-managers—secure compliance to a normative order? How are expressions of submission and resistance woven together in a fabric of cultural understandings? How does a theory of culture enhance our analyses of the reconstitution of political authority from traditional kingship to modern nation-state, the encapsulation of pre-capitalist modes of production, and the attempts to convert "primordial sentiments" to "civic loyalties"? How do transnational fluidities and diasporic connections make instruments of nation-states contingent? These questions are some of the questions we immediately face when probing the intersections of culture, politics and representation, and they are the issues that lie behind this seminar."

"ANTH 423 - The Anthropology of Possible Worlds": {
	Professor: Paul Kockelman
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course focuses on the nature of possible worlds: literary worlds (Narnia), ideological worlds (the world according to a particular political stance), psychological worlds (what someone remembers to be the case, wishes to be the case, or believes to be the case), environmental worlds (possible environmental futures), virtual worlds (the World of Warcraft), and—most of all—ethnographic works in which the actual and possible worlds of others are represented (the world according to the ancient Maya). We don’t focus on the contents of such worlds per se, but rather on the range of resources people have for representing, regimenting, and residing in such worlds; and the roles such resources play in mediating social relations and cultural values."

	Professor: Harvey Weiss
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Why do civilizations collapse? Debates rage among anthropologists, archaeologists, and historians about societal collapse causality, the role of abrupt onset century-scale megadroughts, and adaptive resilience strategies. The seminar examines archaeological, historical, and paleolclimate data and arguments for (1) the synchronous collapses of Early Bronze Age 2200 BCE Mediterranean, West Asia, Egypt, Indus, China, (2) Late Bronze Age 1200 BCE Mediterranean, West Asia, Egypt collapses, (3) the abrupt fall of the Assyrian Empire 612 BCE, (4) Maya region disintegration ca. 800 CE,  (5) Ancestral Pueblo 1300 CE abandonments, and (6) the Late Victorian Holocausts late 19th century India. To judge from the competing claims of social scientists and paleoclimatologists, we are not likely to resolve all arguments. We will, however, illuminate weaknesses, strengths, and "data frontiers. Advancing the frontiers of knowledge about the past also elevates discussion and analysis of the present. We might ask, "How are we adapting to an abrupt anthropogenic climate change?" as productively as we ask, "Is the present the past?" In the context of the abrupt climate change and societal collapse frame that we have created, the last seminar meeting examines the Anthropocene and "The Mystery of Anthropocene Causality.""

Working across media from policy to poetry, film to form, memoir to historiography, fiction to finance, Groundlessness troubles and complicates the grounds and grounding(s) of urban and environmental imaginaries. Attending to cultural, aesthetic, technological, legal, economic, and environmental conditions, this course asks how these factors shape the work of the racial as visually and spatially performed (and in part, contribute to disdain for housing the black and poor in tall towers; the difficulty with imagining folks racialized as black holding a position up in the sky). Groundlessness explores the many ways the work of constructing the built environment occurs well before and beyond the involvement of any architect; and ultimately seeks out the promise and freedoms of leaving the land behind (and below), living untethered from the land, on invented lands, unstable ground, off the ground, and up high."

"ART 468 - Advanced Graphic Design: Ad Hoc Series and Systems": {
	Professor: Julian Bittiner
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Much of the field of design concerns itself with devising systems in an attempt to create aesthetic coherence and reduce creative uncertainties, seeking efficiencies with respect to time, production and materials. However this strategy always comes up against each individual set of circumstances; the materials and content at hand, a particular cast of collaborators, a given timeframe. There is an element of the ad hoc in every piece of design; a need to improvise, interpret, adapt, make exceptions. A second thematic concern of this class is the exploration of medium-specificity and medium-porosity as they relate to such systems. The course is comprised of a series of interconnected prompts across distinct formats in print, motion, and interactive, at a wide variety of scales. A third and final thread is the cultivation of greater awareness of the evolving social and aesthetic functions of design processes, artifacts, and channels of engagement and distribution, within increasingly complex cultural contexts."

Speech, like many aspects of human behavior, involve action and perception components, which are mediated and related by the central nervous system. Each of these components unfolds over time according to laws, which can be formulated using dynamical systems theory. This class provides an introduction to the types of dynamical systems that have been proposed to describe and explain human speech behavior, including (1) articulatory kinematics, i.e., the movements of speech organs such as the tongue, lips, vocal folds, etc., (2) neural activity governing intention and control, and (3) auditory transduction and perception of speech sound waves."

	Professor: Julian Jara-Ettinger
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Leibniz compared the brain to a mill, Freud to a hydraulic system, and now we think of it as a computer. Have we gotten it right? If so, what kind of computer is the brain? And what kind of software is the mind? This course explores these questions by integrating classical and cutting-edge findings from artificial intelligence, cognitive science, neuroscience, philosophy, and psychology. In this course you learn how modern artificial intelligence works—including deep neural networks, program synthesis, and neuro-symbolic approaches. You learn how to think about artificial intelligence from the perspectives of cognitive science and neuroscience. And you learn how current advances in AI are helping us understand how the mind and brain works. Conversely, you also learn how advances in psychology and neuroscience have played a key role in the biggest ideas in AI. This course is ideal for a variety of students: Psychology and cognitive science majors that want to learn about AI. CS students that want to know how to think about AI from a cognitive perspective. And anyone who wants to know how to think critically about all the advances in the study of minds, brains, and machines."

"CGSC 427 - The Rise and Fall of Wonder: When Early Passions for Exploration and Discovery Decay with Age": {
	Professor: Frank Keil
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Research on children’s minds reveals early emerging abilities that help explain the developmental origins and early growth of wonder. We consider wonder as the joy of exploration and discovery. Preschoolers and even infants are driven to learn not just facts and statistics, but also underlying causal patterns that are at the heart of many sciences. They learn not just as individual but also as members of knowledge communities and, early on, they sense how to "harvest" knowledge from these communities. Yet, those joyous moments of discovery and exploration often fade as children grow older and cease to wonder. We explore how this decline occurs and its consequences.  When people stop wondering, they fail to expand their grasps of the world and become ever more vulnerable to misunderstanding and manipulation by others. We examine possible ways to reverse the decline."

"CHLD 128 - Language, Literacy, and Play": {
	Professor: Ann Close
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The focus of this course will be to demonstrate the complicated role that play has in the development of language and literacy skills. A major part of each topic presentation will be a discussion of the role that play has in the curriculum in enhancing these developmental areas. There is a widespread consensus that play is an essential component of a developmentally appropriate early childhood curriculum. Research indicates that play enhances a child’s creativity, intellectual development and social emotional development. Because learning to play, learning language and learning literacy skills are all part of the process of thinking and communication, the course will provide a view which attempts to demonstrate the integration of language, literacy and play in an early childhood education curriculum. Theoretical aspects of each of these developmental areas will be examined first, and it will be that theoretical understanding which will be the basis upon which ideas about curriculum will be explored, experienced and discussed. Students must arrange to do a weekly one-hour observation (in-person or virtually) of a child under age 6 and an additional 2 hour in-person classroom observation at Calvin Hill Day Care Center or another Yale-affiliated child care center. Total observation time commitment is 3 hours per week. If you are unable to find a child to observe, please do not register for this class."

"CLCV 110 - Power of Persuasion, Art of Speaking Well: An Introduction to Ancient Rhetoric": {
	Professor: Rosalie Stoner
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Composed of three parallel strands, this course seeks to introduce students to the dynamic traditions of speaking—and theorizing about speaking—that arose in the milieus of ancient Greece and Rome and continue to influence American society today. We undertake a historical survey of ancient rhetoric, supplementing George Kennedy’s A New History of Classical Rhetoric with excerpted primary readings from the sources it covers during the first meeting of the week. During the second meeting of the week we read and analyze Aristotle’s Art of Rhetoric with the goal of studying how Greek antiquity’s premier treatise on rhetoric interacts with evidence from rhetorical practice (or competing works of rhetorical theory) over the period under consideration. We also pause periodically in our reading of Aristotle to "spotlight" five famous speeches (by Demosthenes, Cicero, Gregory of Nazianzus, Elizabeth I, and Frederick Douglass) that draw on and contribute to the richness of the classical rhetorical tradition and its afterlife."

"CLCV 177 - Medicine, Magic, Miracle": {
	Professor: No professor
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This lecture course examines the interwoven topics of medicine, magic, and miracle in ancient Mediterranean communities. This is an introductory course focusing on the literature, culture, and material artifacts of eastern Mediterranean communities from c.500 BCE-400 CE. Investigating these sources, we ask: How have the scholarly and popular categories of medicine, magic, and miracle aided or obscured our understanding of approaches to the divine, to ritual, to health, and to the human body? Should we parse these categories, and did the ancient individuals who used to lived in the eastern Mediterranean? There is special focus on stories of the miracles of Jesus and apostles, the cult of Asclepius, Hippocratic Greek medicine, the phenomenon of curse tablets and incantations in the ancient world, and non-normate ("disabled") bodies in antiquity, including those who identified as women. The course includes time with Greco-Egyptian amulets in the Yale Babylonian collection and amulets/curses in lead and on papyri at the Beinecke Library."

"CLCV 248 - Daily life in Greco-Roman Egypt": {
	Professor: Joseph Manning
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course intends to fill the gap between Ancient History survey courses and areas of more specialized knowledge within the discipline. One of these specialized fields is Papyrology, which examines texts written in both Greek and demotic Egyptian languages evidencing various aspects of ancient life in the most densely-documented place in the ancient Mediterranean world, Egypt. The aim is to introduce the student to the history and culture of Ptolemaic and Roman period Egypt, and to explore the ancient sources themselves and how scholars work with them. Egypt in this period, from roughly 300 BCE to 300 CE, in many ways occupies a pivotal place in world history. Two of the great world religions, Judaism and Christianity, rose to prominence in Egypt during this period; world trade was extended for the first time from the Mediterranean to the Far East through Egyptian ports on the Red Sea; coinage was used in market exchange; and the sciences as well as philosophy were extended and developed. Societies became truly "multi-cultural" for the first time, and we can explore this phenomenon in great depth. We also, again for the first time, are able to study women’s history in fine detail. By the end of the course, students have a sound foundation of the basic facts and the sources of the period and socio-economic trends of the period, which in some ways mark the beginning of the modern world. Students better understand the context of the rise of Rome, the split between the Latin West and the Greek East, the coming of Islam, and ultimately just how intimately bound together we moderns are to those who lived along the Nile two thousand years ago."

"CLCV 303 - Drama and Justice": {
	Professor: Malina Buturovic
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course focuses primarily on questions of justice in tragedies by the three so-called ‘canonical’ dramatists of ancient Greece – Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides – and in modern-day adaptations of their works by playwrights of the 20th and 21st centuries. These modern playwrights come from different cultures and continents, write in different styles, and explore different contexts and concerns in their adaptations. All are influenced by Greek drama, but also by a much wider range of traditions. In focusing on playwrights’ adaptations of Greek drama in particular, this course asks: why would modern playwrights use ancient Greek material to reflect present concerns? In what ways do modern playwrights reflect the influence of Greek drama? In what ways do they reject that influence? How do they negotiate and contest the Graeco-Roman ‘classical’ tradition in their works? How has Greek drama been used to reflect on questions of justice?"

"CLCV 372 - Gifts For The Gods In The Pre-Modern World": {
	Professor: Alexander Ekserdjian
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course treats the ways in which objects have been used as mediators between people and super-human forces in the pre-modern world. Given in hope of healing, in thanks for beneficence, to secure favor in the future, or to gain merit, dedications to the gods (and the language used to describe them) attest in immediate and visceral ways to the relationships between people and the divine. Global in scope, but with a focus on the ancient Mediterranean, this seminar analyzes gifts to the gods created by different cultures in their own contexts, only secondarily comparing the phenomenon in its varied manifestations. Using the questions and approaches of art history, anthropology, and literary analysis together, this course aims to shed new light on places, periods, and works of art not normally brought together. Contexts considered includes the cenotes of the Yucatán, the sanctuaries of the ancient Mediterranean and Mesopotamia, and the stupas of South Asia."

"CLCV 445 - Coinage and Money through the Ages": {
	Professor: No professor
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This is a hands-on course about the history of money and coinage through the ages, from barter and ingots to the modern era. It is intended as an introductory course to numismatics as a discipline and how to use numismatics as a primary source. Students learn about the history of the discipline, terminology, and numismatic methodology, as well as museum aspects and approaches to the field. Students handle objects from the Yale University Art Gallery’s Numismatic Collection, the largest university collection in North America. This course aims to provide a chronological and geographical overview from the birth and development of coinage in the 7th century B.C. to the 20th century. The course takes an empirical approach to numismatics based on the study of the objects themselves. It does not cover all aspects of the history of coinage or money, but it provides students the tools necessary to do so themselves."

"CSBK 220 - The Ornamented Cosmos": {
	Professor: Misha Semenov-Leiva
	Credits: 1
	Description: "From foliated friezes to snaking spirals, gruesome gargoyles to graceful guilloches, humans have used ornament for millennia to adorn our objects and buildings. What is the function of ornament, then and now? How does it mediate between the objects it adorns, the viewers it addresses, and the cosmos? What role does it play in orchestrating our sense of space, order, and time? And is there scientific evidence for any of these claims? This interdisciplinary seminar explores these questions through historical analysis, research, and hands-on design while finding empirical grounding in the emerging fields of neuroaesthetics and biophilic design. As we study historic precedents and the fundamental geometric properties of ornament, we also research how these patterns are perceived by the brain, both in the scientific literature and through the use of biometric tools at the Center for Collaborative Arts and Media and Wu Tsai Institute.  Basic drawing exercises introduce symmetry operations, tessellation, repeat patterns, and foliation, building a basic fluency in the language of ornament. Field trips to museums and an ornament fabrication studio connect course content to real objects and fabrication techniques. The seminar culminates in a final project that challenges students to apply ornament to an everyday object."

"CSGH 220 - Telling Stories With Maps: From Ancient Times to the New York Times": {
	Professor: Aaron Reiss
	Credits: 1
	Description: "From ancient mariners’ best guesses of what exists beyond the known world to high-tech visual journalism in modern war zones — maps throughout time have been used to construct narratives, make arguments, and find sense in the abstract. How do maps play a role in border conflicts or colonial occupations? How can maps change the way we understand the places we come from? How can we read the biases and points of view inherent in a given map, or put forward those of our own? Students tackle these questions about the history, role, and significance of maps-in-storytelling through academic texts, investigative visual journalism, close readings of maps, and making maps of their own. Most course work revolves around students creating digital, interactive "map stories" on topics of their own choosing. While employing the cartographic and narrative strategies we study in class, students become visual journalists and digital storytellers in their own right. Class is divided between lectures and tutorials. In lectures, we survey historic and modern maps to learn how they tell stories... and can also tell lies. In tutorials, we learn how to design and code interactive map stories of our own, starting from the very basics."

}
"CSPC 220 - Immersive Journalism": {
	Professor: Jeffrey Hobbs
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Each student in this course conceives, researches, workshops, writes, and rewrites a longform nonfiction piece of substantial scope and depth. One of the primary tasks in this semester-long progression is to interpret individually what the concept of "immersion" means in journalism and how to give readers a truthful sense of presence in a world. This class also makes space in which to explore the emotional terrain of this deeply involving form of storytelling. Weekly readings and shorter writing assignments explore techniques by which to assemble comprehensive narratives. In addition to traditional discussion and workshopping, the learning relies on group activities such as debates, presentations, mock interviews, and peer editing. Ethics and integrity are recurrent themes; the quality of the class depends on high standards of both. This class encourages (but does not require) writing grown from topics of personal significance. Students can expect to devote equal time and effort to developing original voices that amplify their stories and striving to help classmates do the same."

"CSSY 220 - Game Theory in Action: From Poker to Business Negotiations": {
	Professor: Daniel Singer
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Negotiation is essential: it is only the alternative to violence and coercion in public policy and a prerequisite to all economic activity. The food on your table, the electricity in your building, and the music in your ears could not exist without a long, complex series of negotiations. Yet, few of us consider ourselves confident, expert negotiators. We fear that we will be exploited and deceived (leaving money on the table) or that others will see us as too demanding or too greedy (and therefore untrustworthy). Game Theory in Action brings math and logic to the bargaining table. Students compete in seven simulated negotiations, progressing to business situations drawn from the sports, gaming, and entertainment industries. Poker is our entry point to game theory, teaching us to estimate expected value, detect patterns in opponents’ behavior, and bluff selectively to avoid being exploited. Game Theory in Action draws on academic literature, the instructor’s three decades of experience in high-stakes negotiations, and the expertise of senior executives in sports, media, and entertainment."
}
"CSTC 220 - Refusal: The Limits of Protest and Decolonization": {
	Professor: Ian MacMillen
	Credits: 1
	Description: "As Haudenosaunee (Mohawk) anthropologist Audra Simpson documented, when the 2010 Iroquois lacrosse team "refused" to travel to England on non-Haudenosaunee passports, it cost them their spot in the world championship in Manchester, which would have recognized their nation's sovereign status on the world stage. How might we understand this refusal, neither as protest nor as admission of decolonization's futility, but as a sovereign practice of constraint? What new political acts might emerge if we think of such limits, less as oppressive limitations, than as productive sites of engagement: as constrained activism, avoiding both (post)colonial government mandates and the resistance modalities typically used to counter state structures (modalities that often engage the state on its own terms)? This course takes diverse Indigenous acts and theories of refusal as a starting point for examining related practices within a global, comparative framework. Emphasizing ethnographic disciplines, the course also draws from rhetoric, history, and politics to unpack refusal's nuances as an endeavor defined by additive action as much as by restriction. Discussing current events, readings, multimedia, guest visits, and performances (e.g. Yale’s biannual powwow), students will learn the practices of sacrifice and rejection that have remade both Indigenous and migrant/settler/diasporic political lives."

"CSTD 220 - Step Right Up: The History of the American Circus": {
	Professor: Betsy Kellem
	Credits: 1
	Description: "From America’s founding, through the heyday of P.T. Barnum’s Greatest Show on Earth, and into a modern era characterized by elephant parades and arena shows, circus performance is a key part of the American cultural experience. Not only has the circus directly influenced generations of audience members with colorful entertainment, it has added countless idioms, spin-off entertainments, archetypes, and ideas to our popular culture. At its golden-age height, the American circus spent and earned millions of dollars, employed thousands of workers, and dealt with the business and regulatory realities of any major corporation in the nineteenth century, all with the added pressure that it be able to transport itself over state lines quickly and often. It has left an indelible mark on American life and popular culture. This course examines the history and impact of the American circus from the 18th century through to today. With attention to historiography, labor issues, race, gender and disability studies, we explore material culture, menageries, clowning, animals in performance, business, logistics, mass media, and performance."

	Professor: Tian Li
	Credits: 1
	Description: "What happened to socialism? This course offers an in-depth exploration of this question through the lens of Chinese cinema, from its early days in the early 20th century to the contemporary era. Students examine China's social, political, and cultural transformations, from heteronomy to autonomy, and the ideological transition from socialism to postsocialism. Is socialism with Chinese characteristics interchangeable with capitalism with Chinese characteristics? What impact has revolutionary politics had on Chinese cinema? What is feminism with Chinese characteristics? How do the radical transformations that occurred in China during the 1980s and 1990s manifest in the aesthetics and narratives of Chinese films? How have spatial consciousness and construction of images informed filmmaking in China? How are the sentiments of alienation, disconnection, and displacement depicted in Chinese films? Does globalization bring us closer together or push us towards solitude? The course explores these questions by delving into the cultural dynamics of China's changing identities and ideologies in response to its integration into capitalist globalization. Topics include the evolution of Chinese film generations, cultural politics, postsocialist decay, aesthetics and method of seeing, kinship and love, violence and solitude, fragmentation and disconnection, and feminism with Chinese characteristics in Chinese films. Students critically analyze films by renowned Chinese directors such as Xie Jin, Chen Kaige, Feng Xiaogang, Jia Zhangke, Lou Ye, Zhang Yimou, and Huang Shuqin."

"EAST 389 - Critical Themes in Korean Popular Music": {
	Professor: Bo kyung Im
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This advanced seminar examines Korean popular music from academic perspectives informed by ethnomusicology, Korean studies, and transpacific studies. The course first historicizes the Korean music industry’s dialogical formation with modern political, economic, religious, and military forces such as Western imperialism, Protestant missions, Japanese colonization, the Cold War, military dictatorship, state-sponsored internationalization, and global technosociality. While the first half of the course emphasizes the Korean domestic industry, the second half pivots outward, focusing on reverse directional flows obtained in the late 20th and early 21st century. We interrogate K-pop’s role in constructions of Korea and Asia in the North Atlantic cultural imaginary and pay particular attention to continuities and disjunctures between K-pop and "world music," a genre conventionally marking non-Westerners’ colonial difference in the Western music industry. Themes such as race and racialization, gender and sexuality, migration and diaspora, voice and voicing, and media and technology inform our conversations throughout the semester."

"EAST 423 - Tibet in the Modern World—A 20th Century History": {
	Professor: UGYAN CHOEDUP
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course delves into Tibet's modern history, covering the late nineteenth century to the present. It situates Tibet’s history within the emerging ideological and political landscape shaped by the globalizing force of colonial modernity. By examining pivotal moments in twentieth-century Tibetan history, this course discusses the gradual transformation of the Tibetan world as it encountered new ideas, institutions, and practices from the modern West, often mediated through modern China and colonial and post-colonial India. Emphasizing that the present state of Tibet's future was not predetermined, the course delves into the diverse visions for Tibet's destiny that emerged at the beginning of the twentieth century. By exploring these overlooked and unrealized possibilities, it underscores the contingent and contested nature of Tibet's modern history. As such, this course may particularly interest students exploring themes of modernity, nationalism, colonialism, and exile. Through the incorporation of primary sources, students engage directly with first-hand accounts and historical materials, fostering a more intimate understanding of modern Tibetan history."

	Description: "This course is an introduction to macroeconomics. We begin by asking why some countries produce so much more output than others. We investigate the role of savings and investment, research and development, and the economic institutions that determine them. We then ask what determines output, unemployment, inflation, and interest rates over time, why they fluctuate over time, and how policymakers affect them."

The course aims to introduce important ideas and tools from game theory, and use them to answer questions in social sciences, law, and business.  For instance, how does information get sold and used to persuade? How do we think about the efficiency and equity of allocations? How do sellers decide the best format for an auction to sell a good? Does requiring unanimous verdicts guarantee that the innocent will not be convicted? What causes bank runs? When do we see price wars?

This course is divided into three sections: (i) Market Failure: with an analysis of credit, labor, and insurance markets in developing countries. (ii) Social Response: how community networks emerge in response to market failure. We study the positive and negative consequences of this community involvement for growth and development; in the short-run and the long-run. We also provide economic foundations for the emergence of social norms and identity, as well as the dynamic inefficiencies that they can generate with economic development. (iii) Biological Response: how biological adaptation to economic conditions in the pre-modern economy can have negative consequences for nutritional status and health in developing economies. Apart from providing a particular perspective on development, an additional objective of this course demonstrates the use of economic theory in informing empirical research."

This course provides an in-depth examination of computers and their hardware-based security issues. The operation of the hardware, from transistors to processor microarchtiectures, has intimate impact on the security of the whole system. Often, software or algorithms executing on a computer have no control over, or detailed access to, the underlying hardware. Yet, the operation of the hardware and different types of side-effects, such as changing timing, changing power consumption, EM emanations, or different types of crosstalk effects lead to information leakage. To understand the hardware-based security issues, and how to prevent them, the course focuses on classical microporcessors, accelerators such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays, as well as emerging technologies such as Quantum Computers. For the different types of computers, the course teaches students about the various hardware security issues, and students are able to experiment and perform hands-on exercises to demonstrate different types of information leaks.

Examining gothic novels from the 18th and 19th centuries—the stuff of craggy cliffs, mysterious dungeons, and their paranormal inhabitants—alongside 20th and 21st-century films, this course explores the historical origins and deep cultural legacy of literary responses to the so-called Age of Reason. As we tour medieval monasteries, shadowy back alleys of London, and abysmal realms of the subconscious, we consider how literary representations of unreason affirm and unsettle our understanding of lived experience and our faith in laws of science and logic. Gothic fiction has long provided fertile ground for cultivating ideas about race, gender, sexuality, and colonialism—special attention is given to these topics throughout the course. Readings include Frankenstein, Mexican Gothic, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and Dracula. Films include Peele’s Get Out, Bong’s Parasite, and Hitchcock’s Rebecca. Formerly ENGL 063."

}
"ENGL 3149 - History of the English Language": {
	Professor: Peter Grund
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The story of the English language is a remarkable one. During its 1,500-year history, English has gone through striking changes. For example, in the early Middle Ages, the word take did not exist in English; it was later borrowed from the language of the Vikings. When a person in the 16th century claimed that someone was nice, they meant that the person was foolish. In the 17th century, her could be spelled har, her, hor, hur, and hyr by people living in the same community. And more recently we see how like has taken on new functions, especially in quotations. We will explore how and why these, and other developments took place. We look at how major historical events have spurred changes in the English language, and how people from all walks of life (from well-known authors like Shakespeare and Austen to anonymous scribes and letter writers) influence the path of change. Exploring these questions will also force us to consider whether we should more appropriately be talking about "histories of Englishes" rather than "the history of English." By the end of the course, you see how the English you use has been shaped by people and forces over several centuries, and how you yourself contribute to the continuing change of the English language. Formerly ENGL 149."

"ENGL 3150 - Dialect Diversity in English Literature": {
	Professor: Peter Grund
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Eliza Doolittle (in George Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion), Huckleberry Finn (in Mark Twain’s Adventures of Huckleberry Finn), Joseph (in Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights), and Janie Crawford (in Zora Neale Hurston’s Their Eyes Were Watching God) are examples of speakers who use a non-standard dialect in English literature. While these are well-known examples, the use of such dialects (including Cockney, Southern American English, Yorkshire English, and African American English) is common throughout the history of English literature when representing certain characters’ voices; and some works are written entirely in non-standard dialects. In this course, we explore the use and function of dialects of English in a range of literary genres across history (from Old English to Present-Day English) and across the English-speaking world. We use tools and interpretive frameworks from literary scholarship and linguistics to analyze, understand, and explain the use of dialect. We answer questions such as what types of features are used and created to signal dialect; how accurate the usage is in terms of representing actual dialect; and what social, literary, and aesthetic purposes dialect usage may serve. This exploration also makes it necessary to consider critically what it means to write in standard English, why some dialects are evaluated negatively and others positively, and what the implications are of such evaluations for speakers both inside and outside the fictional world."

"ENGL 3444 - Speculative Fiction Workshop": {
	Professor: Marie-Helene Bertino
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Perhaps no form of fiction responds to the surreality of our contemporary society more directly than speculative fiction. Whether it is by imagining a structure whose rooms are inhabited by a couple’s most intimate vulnerabilities (Carmen Maria Machado’s In The Dream House), a society where men bear children (Octavia Butler’s "Bloodchild"), or one in which the memory of household items is policed by a shadowy entity (Yoko Ogawa’s Memory Police), speculative fiction tells the truth under uncanny circumstances. In this writing intensive course, we reimagine and employ fiction’s tools through a speculative lens to render a realistic experience. What is the difference between building an entirely fabricated world and placing one discreet supernatural element into an otherwise realistic story? How can we manipulate time on the page to most effectively express life’s most extraordinary experiences? Our focus is on peer review of student stories produced in tandem with craft lessons that address the concerns of the uncanny and speculative-based writing prompts. With space saved for character building, intentional information dispersal, and sound. We borrow tools from other genres (film, painting, poetry) to help us break the laws of physics in fiction and build a more inclusive space and lexicon for the study of speculative worlds.

"ENGL 3474 - Writing from the Archive: Imagining the Real": {
	Professor: Adina Hoffman
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Where do the dry, who-what-which details set down on a census form meet the far messier and richer reality of the people whose names are scrawled there? And how might a writer bring that meeting about? What can a shoebox of doodle-filled letters tell us about the ways that friendship, art, war, sex, and politics struck a couple of New York novelists, c. 1941? How do we respond as writers and as a culture when faced with the lack of such inky particulars? Blending seminar and workshop, this class is meant for students who want to write literary non-fiction based on archival materials. In an intensive, hands-on fashion, we’ll dig into documents of all sorts as we read essays and excerpts from belletristic works that wrestle with the sometimes slippery fact of the archive. Throughout, we’ll ask how best to bring vital prose into being. Weekly writing experiments that draw from various Yale collections and beyond will encourage students to see and respond to archival discoveries freshly and for themselves. A semester-long writing project will take shape as an extension of that seeing and responding. While no previous archival experience is required, this class calls for a serious commitment to the written word. By permission of instructor. Limit 12."

As we read and write, we put these theoretical concerns into practice and play by writing two or three profiles about people you do not like, a place you don’t care for, an idea you oppose, or an object whose value eludes you. Your writing might be about someone who haunts you without your permission or whatever else gets under your skin, but ideally, your subject makes you uncomfortable, troubles you, and confounds you. Some examples of the writing that we read are Guy Debord, Lucille Clifton, C.L.R. James, Pascale Casanova, W.G. Sebald, Jayne Cortez, AbouMaliq Simone, Greg Tate, Annie Ernaux, Edward Said, Mark Twain, Jacqueline Rose, Toni Morrison, Julia Kristeva, and Ryszard Kapuscinski."

"ENGL 4516 - Religion, Race, and Empire in Medieval Literatures": {
	Professor: Marcel Elias
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course explores approaches to religion, race, and empire in medieval literatures. The Crusades, Europe’s first collective experiment in empire-building, unleashed new ideologies of religious and racial difference. Christian and Muslim authors drew upon their respective scriptures and the ancient Greek heritage they shared to construct polemical images of the "other." These images not only fluctuated in tandem with changing geopolitical circumstances but existed in tension or conflict with others, whose literary and cultural functions transcend mere polemic. Questions that we consider, focus on the genres of epic, romance, travelogue, and dream allegory, including: how did histories of imperial expansionism, indigenous resistance, and peaceful coexistence shape literary production during the Crusades? How do medieval cultural objects perpetuate or unsettle dichotomies of religion and race? What circumstances (historical, geopolitical, personal) prompted writers to question ideas about empire, holy war, and religious others that they inherited from previous generations? The emphasis will be on Christian European writings (in Middle English, Old French, Middle High German, and Latin), but we also read some Arabic materials. These works are read alongside postcolonial criticism, by medievalists and modernists, as well as scholarship on premodern religious culture, ethnography, and race."

"ENGL 4767 - Love and Desire in the Nineteenth Century": {
	Professor: Naomi Levine
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course examines forms of love and desire in Victorian literature, with attention to their philosophical, historical, and aesthetic contexts. We consider how history licensed or constrained the Victorian erotic imagination; how the pleasures of reading and looking shaped nineteenth-century aesthetics; how desire drives literary genres such as the sonnet sequence, the gothic novella, the elegy, the love letter, and aestheticist prose. Authors include Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Sheridan LeFanu, William Morris, Christina Rossetti, Walter Pater, Pauline Johnson (Tekahionwake), Michael Field, and Virginia Woolf, with additional readings in Sappho, Dante, Hegel, Stendhal, and Freud. Visits to the Yale collections inform our discussion. May not be taken for credit with ENGL 267."
}
"ENGL 4831 - What was Latinx Literature": {
	Professor: Joseph Miranda
	Credits: 1
	Description: "With the arrival of "Latinx," the last decade was defined as a moment of rupture and break with traditional notions of latinidad. Artists and activists asserted refusal and historical reckoning as the mode of doing politics and aesthetics. Now, pessimistic about Latinx as a signifier of a unified political project, the generational tides have shifted to "Latine." This seminar asks what is "Latinx literature" and why are the methods of "Latinx studies" considered revolutionary or disruptive? What ideas were rooted in prior generations of feminist and queer collectives that sustained life when the arrival of a decolonial future seemed forever deferred and withheld from reach? We examine contemporary artists alongside historical antecedents to reevaluate what literary and social forms can help us challenge a racialized, heteronormative conception of citizenship. One possibility is that Gloria Anzaldúa—rightly critiqued for her relation to mestizaje —might be helpful in this moment of growing nationalism and hostility towards migrants to think about other ways of organizing life aside borders and the nation. We read across a long and varied arc of creative expression to consider forms that endure amidst colonial duress. For example: the serial, montage, anthology, performance collective, and inter-linked storytelling. Artists up for discussion may include Natalie Diaz, John Rechy, and Jesús Colón. Students will engage these works alongside theorists like José Esteban Muñoz and Juana María Rodríguez. Previously ENGL 331."

Previously ENGL 344."
}
"ENGL 4898 - The Sensuous Life of Empire": {
	Professor: Rasheed Tazudeen
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course examines the cross-sections of material culture, imperial consumption, and racial fetishism. In thinking the material traces of empire—its histories, archives, and counter-archives—we adopt a multi-sensory approach that emphasizes the tactile, the sonic, and the olfactory as modes of both enacting and resisting imperial desires. A decolonial sensorium, this course wagers, attunes us to empire’s failures to inscribe matter, flesh, pixels, ripples, beats, cries, and scars into systems of meaning, and thus opens new, insurgent spaces for feeling, hearing, thinking, and being. The role of vision and visuality in the sensuous life of race and empire has been well-examined. In shifting the focus to imperial and counter-imperial textures, surfaces, sounds, and scents, this course explores a wider array of sensory regimes and subject-object relations. How do the textures of objects such as mammy figurines, silks, and cake mixes materialize imperial fantasies? What happens to our idea of the human subject when we encounter it at the level of skin, hair, flesh, musculature, and other of its seemingly inalienable or eminently disposable components? How might we hear the sounds of Creole and Black vernacular speech and music against the grain of colonial inscriptive practices and technologies? In terms of method, the thinkers whom we engage throughout the term cut across a range of disciplines, genres, and media. Although many of our readings are "about" materiality, we also attend to how each text evokes and enacts materiality and the labors of the senses. Formerly ENGL 398."

"EP&E 216 - Classics of EPE: African-American Perspectives": {
	Professor: Gregory Collins
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The purpose of this course is to examine the interdisciplinary subjects of ethics, politics, and economics through the lens of African-American thought and to grasp how African-American thinkers have deepened our understanding of the interaction between race and socioeconomic debates and controversies throughout U.S. history. Far from being a univocal tradition, African-American thought encompasses a rich variety of intellectual perspectives that have critically assessed the impact of slavery, education, capitalism, and religion, among a number of topics, on African-Americans. While the study of American racial relations can include a wide range of topics, our thematic focus remains on the ethical, political, sociological, and economic dimensions of African-American experiences from the eighteenth century to the present day. This inquiry further prompts us to reflect on the various conceptions of liberty, justice, and equality that have informed the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution and that lie at the core of intellectual discussion over race in American history."

"EP&E 230 - The Geopolitics of Democracy": {
	Professor: Lauren Young
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The threats to liberal democracy are being widely debated, from the US and Europe to developing nations.   In order for democracy to continue to thrive as the cornerstone of Western governance, it must adapt and be relevant to citizens of the 21st century. This course examines our appreciation of what constitutes democracy today and how to apply those understandings to the challenges of the 21st century. Our discussions look at the characteristics of democratic leaders and debate whether America, the bulwark of liberal democracy in the 20th century, is still an exporter of democracy and how that matters in today’s world. We then look at how to protect and adapt democratic institutions such as free elections, civil society, dissent, and the free press in the face of a rising wave of populism and nationalism. The course examines how refugee crises from conflict regions and immigration impact democracies and debate the accelerating paradigm shifts of income inequality and technology on democratic institutions.  We conclude the course with a discussion of the forms of democratic governance that are meaningful in the 21st century and the practicalities of designing or reforming democratic institutions to confront current challenges."

"EP&E 232 - Comparative Political Parties and Public Policies": {
	Professor: Isabela Mares
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Political parties are a key institution at the heart of representative democracies. The organization of parties, their connections to voters and interest groups and their use of programmatic and nonprogrammatic promises in appealing to voters varies significantly across countries. The goal of this course is to familiarize students with comparative research on party and party systems. We examine the historical development of political parties, examining the processes by which different societal ‘cleavages’ lead to the formation of new parties and the importance of electoral laws in accounting for different party configurations. We next provide an overview of the dynamics of party development during the postwar period, examining processes of polarization and depolarization of the party landscape, the relationship between parties and interest groups, the contribution of different parties to policy developments and changes in political representation."

The course examines the development of parliamentary government in Britain, political development, and comparative constitutionalism among states in the United States,"
}
"EP&E 254 - The Ethics of Work": {
	Professor: Max Lewis
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Work structures our daily existence. If we are not getting ready for work, we’re on our way to work, or we’re heading home from work. All the while, we’re trying to find a "work-life balance." Most of us spend at least half of our waking lives working. In fact, one primary reason that we go to college is so that we can get a "good job." But why do we want to work? Does working provide goods (other than money)? Are there goods unique to work? Can work be a source of meaning in our lives? Is there anything inherently bad about working or are the ways work is currently structured bad? Do we have a right to work? Do we have a duty to work? Should power structures at workplaces match those of a country (e.g., be democratic)? Would it be preferable to severely reduce work hours or completely eliminate work? Should we use technology to automate not only jobs but also housework and errands? These are some of the questions we address as we consider the ethics of work through classical texts in ethics, politics, and economics (e.g., by Aristotle, Locke, Smith, Marx, etc.) and modern debates in ethics and politics."
}
"EP&E 255 - Morality and Relationships": {
	Professor: Max Lewis
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course explores the nuances of two kinds of relationships: interpersonal relationships and normative relationships. The course starts with foundational work in relational ethics which connects ethics with moral accountability, e.g., moral demands, claims, blame, apology, forgiveness, etc. With a grasp of these views in place, we turn toward the morality of interpersonal relationships. Interpersonal relationships are a central part of our lives. As social creatures, they are essential for our well-being and the meaningfulness of our lives. But they raise important moral questions. For example, do we have special obligations to our friends, family, or co-national? Are we epistemically permitted to ignore evidence if it indicates that our friend or family has done something wrong? Is there a conflict between what morality requires and what is required for being a good friend or family member? What’s wrong or bad about being friends with an immoral person? We also explore psychological and moral aspects of these relationships, e.g., what does loving a person consist of? What reasons do we have to love others? Do we owe our loved ones debts of gratitude?"
}
"EP&E 300 - Capitalism and its Critics: Foundational Thinkers of Business Ethics": {
	Professor: Gregory Collins
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The question of whether capitalism is moral may seem like a recent debate, but its roots are grounded in the wisdom of philosophers and economists spanning back to classical antiquity who have reflected on the ethical implications of market activities. The purpose of this course is to critically examine these thinkers’ understanding of the connection between markets and morals and grasp how they have built the intellectual foundation of the modern business ethics discipline. We address the thinkers’ perspectives on the ethical, social, historical, and religious dimensions of property rights, profit, money, free trade, and shareholder and stakeholder theories of corporate management, among a variety of topics. We also explore deeper philosophical dilemmas about the relation between market exchange and conceptions of human nature, equality, liberty, the common good, commodification, social and economic complexity, justice, and reason and its limits."

What are an individual’s rights and responsibilities in the face of illness, and how do public health organizations prioritize competing claims? How should issues of consent, quarantine, compulsory treatment, and surveillance be managed, and how do these issues change as they transcend geographic borders? This seminar examines critical issues in global health through the method of ethical analysis. The course begins with the foundations for analyzing ethical problems, considering moral and ethical frameworks for health. We examine dilemmas such as quarantines, access to care, and the limits of autonomy, and we delve into critical challenges of vulnerable populations and global inequities. We conclude by analyzing emerging tensions posed by artificial intelligence and digital health technologies. Drawing together global health perspectives and ethical analysis, we consider the principles, tradeoffs, and central tensions that inform global health today."

	Professor: Grace Kao
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This class explores the Hallyu (한류  or 韓流) or The Korean Wave, primarily with respect to K-Pop and K-Dramas. No knowledge of Korea, K-Pop, or K-Dramas is required, but some familiarity with K-Dramas and/or K-Pop is helpful. Korea has been extraordinarily successful in exporting these cultural products and in doing so, it has exposed the friction in cultural understandings of national origin, race, gender, and sexuality. In addition to the readings, you are expected to watch some K-Dramas and K-Pop. Specifically, each student is part of a team that watches one entire short K-Drama (usually 8 episodes) or half of a typical length K-Drama (16 episodes) during the first part of the class. Once we turn to K-Pop, there are weekly YouTube playlists of music videos for you to watch. You also read and comment on two episodes of 2 Korean webtoons."

"ER&M 442 - Afro-Latin America": {
	Professor: Gana Ndiaye
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The number of people of African descent in Latin America is about 50 million. Brazil, for instance, has the largest Black population outside of Africa. Yet discussions of Afro-descendants in the Americas focus primarily on the United States and the Caribbean. The large presence of people of African descent in Latin America has also been obscured by narratives of "racial democracy," "mestizaje," and "disappearance" of Black people, among other national tales that contrast the region to the U.S., with its history of legal racial segregation. This course is about the past and present of Latin Americans of African descent and their contributions to the cultures of Latin America. Through a multidisciplinary approach, the course highlights expressions of Afro-Latin culture in the region and abroad, as well as contemporary mobilizations against racial discrimination and economic inequality. Other topics of discussion in this course include religion, political representation, cultural preservation, land rights, and environmental justice. By the end of the course, students 1) gain a deeper understanding of the history and cultures of people of African descent in Latin America and 2) hone their critical reading, writing, and oral presentation skills."

"ER&M 443 - Who is Black and Where?": {
	Professor: Gana Ndiaye
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The acclaimed Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Adichie wrote that she "became Black in America." Stories of immigrants from Latin America who are racialized as non-Black at home "discovering" themselves Black in the United States also abound.  So, who is really Black, and where?  In this course, we investigate this question in various locales and epochs, tracing discourses in anthropology, media, literature, and other disciplines that have shaped global understanding of Blackness as a site of identity and a social, cultural, and political formation in the context of capitalism and colonialism. The course pays particular attention to how colonialism has mobilized forces such as religion and science to cement and justify racial hierarchies, often placing Blackness at the bottom. We also explore the variegated forms of anti-Blackness and their contestations in the United States and beyond. We then turn to how contemporary transnational migrations have generated racial frictions and new understandings of who counts as Black. By the end of the course, students 1) gain a deeper understanding of the dynamic nature of Black identity and what being racialized as Black entails in a global context, 2) hone their critical reading and writing skills, and 3) develop ethnographic interview skills."

"EVST 209 - Making Climate Knowledge": {
	Professor: No professor
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This is a course about how humans have come to know what we know about our impacts on the earth’s climate and our vulnerability to climate change. When did humans first know that their actions, in the aggregate, could transform the planet? Did scientists bear responsibility to warn of these consequences? In what ways has the modern science of climate both appropriated and undermined traditional and indigenous forms of climate knowledge? Students learn to work with the methods of history of science: we analyze science as a social and material process bound to the cultural and epistemological particularities of its historical context, and we examine the political dimensions of historical narratives about the emergence of the theory of global warming. Via hands-on experience with Yale’s historical collections, students learn to analyze maps, artifacts, and instruments as historical sources. They also gain familiarity with the methods of environmental history, learning to attend to historical evidence of shifting relationships between humans and non-humans. Finally, students become more attuned to the evidence of climate change around them and more confident in their ability to make climate knowledge for themselves."

}
"EVST 450 - Carbon Containment": {
	Professor: Dean Takahashi
	Credits: 1
	Description: "As greenhouse gases (GHGs) accumulate in the atmosphere, it is increasingly important to deploy both emission reductions and carbon dioxide removal (CDR)—together termed ‘carbon containment.’ A wide range of carbon containment technologies are being worked on today, yet this relatively nascent field must overcome technical, logistical, ethical, and financial challenges before contributing to stabilize the climate at scale. In this course, we examine the need, scale, and timelines for carbon containment as expressed by international climate commitments and corporate climate goals. Then, we examine the scientific foundations for key carbon containment pathways including emission reductions of key short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) as well as CDR in biologic, geologic and engineered systems. Finally, we investigate the challenges facing these carbon containment approaches, including siting, commercialization, measuring, and communicating the costs and benefits of these approaches to different audiences. We discuss how carbon containment pathways affect environmental justice concerns and goals in different regions of the US and internationally. Over the course of the semester, students do an investigation of one carbon containment approach, culminating in a report describing key components of the science, economics, social license, and regulatory landscape, and ultimately, a pathway to scale."

"FILM 424 - What Is or Was an Image?": {
	Professor: Wanda Strauven
	Credits: 1
	Description: "How can we define the image in the digital age? Vilém Flusser once remarked that the composite essence of digital technology was already embedded in photography because the photographic image is an image composed of points, which the human eye synthesizes into an image. This seminar proposes not only to revisit Flusser’s notion of the "technical image" in light of today’s changes in visual culture but also to rethink the history of image technologies beyond (or beneath) their visual dimensions. Starting with 15th- and 16th-century perspectival images and drawing tools—from Alberti’s "veil" to Dürer’s grid—, we trace the origins of the digital image with detours in the history of textile and the invention of the Jacquard loom, patented in 1804. Subsequently, the course analyzes 19th-century optical devices and so-called philosophical toys that required manual operation to produce the illusion of a moving image, fooling the human eye. Moving into the 20th century, Vertov’s "kino-eye" is reread as an early theory of machine vision. Other topics are: the indexicality of the photographic image, the haptic quality of the video image, the operational image of surveillance and warfare, the history of 3D images, CGIs, and GIFs. What is or was there to see? Do we (still) need to believe our eyes? Lastly, we study the non-visual dimension of the screenic image and the emergence of AI generated images."

"FILM 438 - Media Anxieties": {
	Professor: Francesco Casetti
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This seminar delves into the multifaceted anxieties entwined with our always-connected lives. In an era where the digital permeates every aspect of our daily experience, from communication to identity formation, understanding the complex emotions it generates is paramount. Drawing from diverse methodologies such as film history, German media theory, affect theory, critical data studies, gender studies, and disability studies, this seminar provides a comprehensive examination of the intersection between media as technological dispositifs and the human psyche. Drawing on a plethora of thinkers, students explore how black box technologies produce and sustain regimes of anxiety, fear and dependency. Students critically analyze how ubiquitous technologies shape our perceptions, behaviors, and anxieties. Through examining historical and contemporary media artifacts, theoretical frameworks, and interdisciplinary perspectives, participants explore topics including cinephilia/cinephobia, surveillance culture, algorithmic biases, addiction, and the politics of representation in digital spaces. This seminar encourages interdisciplinary dialogue and fosters critical thinking skills necessary for navigating the evolving digital landscape in an informed and ethically conscious manner."

"FILM 454 - Timbre: from Orchestration to Foley Art": {
	Professor: Giulia Accornero
	Credits: 1
	Description: "All of us can call to mind a voice that we love, an instrumental quality that makes us shiver, a sound that brings back sweet memories. But if we were asked "what does it sound like?", we would probably be at a loss for words. Timbre, also known as "color" or "sound quality," is possibly the most sensual and yet ungraspable aspect of musical sound.  It has often been treated as a "wastebasket" category, negatively defined as everything that is neither pitch, nor loudness. And yet, as timbre is one of the predominant features of much of the music composed since the middle years of the twentieth century in a variety of genres, it is time to root through the wastebasket and start putting things in order. Throughout the semester, drawing on a bibliography that spans musicology, ethnomusicology, music theory, music cognition, sound studies, and film studies, we develop an "ear," a vocabulary, analytical techniques, and the cultural sensitivity necessary to identify and name timbral characteristics as effectively as possible. As notions of timbre are historically and geographically situated, so is our class: we consider music and sound across genres and media from the eighteenth century to the present, remaining mostly in the so-called Western world."

The goal is to teach students how to think systematically about the topic through various lenses. The organization of this course is different from the typical undergraduate course. It is divided into four modules and each module focuses on a particular topic. The course is a mix of lectures and class discussions. The general themes we explore this semester are Democracy, Globalization, and their complex interrelations.  We approach these topics from both a conceptual and a practical perspective, in the latter case focusing on the experience of some specific countries: two of the largest economies in the world, China and India, as well as a smaller emerging market, Vietnam. Note: The course is designed as a higher-level course equivalent to a 200-course numbering, despite its current numbering. Please ensure that you have the course prerequisites below before registering."

"GLBL 287 - Capitalism and Crisis": {
	Professor: Isabela Mares
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course provides an introduction to the study of comparative capitalism. We examine how institutions organizing labor markets, finance and the welfare state differ systematically across advanced industrialized countries and the consequence of these differences for a variety of economic and policy outcomes. These include economic growth, unemployment, levels of inequality and so on. Can we meaningfully talk about a German or Swedish model and if so, what are the main institutional arrangements that differ across these economies? How do institutions in these countries differ from more liberal capitalist economies, such as the United States? In the second part of the course, we examine the responses of different countries to a variety of economic shocks. These include the stagflation crisis of the 1970’s, the slowdown in economic growth, deindustrialization, the rise in unemployment and inequality and the migration crisis. We examine how existing political and economic institutions have shaped the policy trade-offs encountered by different countries and we explain the different political responses taken in response to these crises. During the period between November 14 and November 24, enrollment will be limited to majors. After November 24, registration will be opened to all Yale College students.

"GLBL 298 - Food & Power in US Foreign Relations": {
	Professor: Kaete OConnell
	Credits: 1
	Description: "More than simply "sustenance," food has played a pivotal role in the shaping of societies, the development of nations, and the waging of war throughout human history. This course examines the histories of food production and consumption in the United States, with a focus on how food guides American interactions with people, markets, and governments across the globe. Readings explore the many ways food, as a physical object and social symbol, shaped American foreign relations in formal and informal ways. Our patterns of consumption not only reflect how we see ourselves—we are what we eat—but also draw important distinctions between friend and foe, who we welcome at our table and choose to break bread with. Topics include empire and exploitation, government regulation, matters of taste, war and famine, agriculture and nutritional science, consumer politics, industrial food production, and the globalization of food systems. Students are introduced to the field of U.S. food studies and exposed to a variety of methodologies and styles to better understand how American agricultural abundance shaped U.S. foreign policy in the twentieth century."
}
"GLBL 317 - China's Sovereign Lending": {
	Professor: James Sundquist
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This is a course about when governments borrow from foreign lenders and the political causes and consequences of the decision to borrow. To enable us to focus on politics, some training in economics is required. We begin by reviewing the internal determinants of China’s external lending behavior. Next, we study how international finance collides with domestic politics creating both opportunities and challenges for borrowers. The second half of the course surveys topics of contemporary importance: how effective is Chinese economic statecraft? Can China expect to be repaid in full? Will the renminbi become a global reserve currency?"
}
"GLBL 328 - Reopening & Reimagining Africa": {
	Professor: Harry Thomas
	Credits: 1
	Description: "It is time to "reopen and reimagine Africa." This course requires students to research and redesign policies that are intended to help African nations emerge economically stronger and with a population that is better educated and healthier by 2050. We examine, analyze, and support and/or criticize the long-term policies of African nations. Students are required to engage up-and-coming African scholars, businesspersons, educators, and policymakers to ensure that the recommendations are not conceived in a vacuum. We examine the obstacles and challenges of Great Power Competition among the U.S., the PRC, Russia, and the EU on Africa and design alternative policies."
}
"GLBL 337 - Colonialism and Development": {
	Professor: Alden Young
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course introduces students to the approaches and intellectual traditions of critical development studies. The violence of colonization and the struggle for decolonization are two of the defining processes of the Twentieth Century. We ask how development as a global good can be reconciled with its origins in colonialism. Second, we ask how development became a hegemonic way of imagining decolonization. This course focuses on voices of critique, and it pays special emphasis to the models of development that emerged from Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. We end by discussing the relationships between rival notions of development and competing ideas of international relations. Temporarily this course begins with the Age of European Overseas Empires and continues to the Present.  The first half of the course focuses on how development as a concept emerged historically in conjunction with Empire, Imperialism and Colonialism. The second half of the course asks if it is possible to imagine development beyond frameworks of hierarchy and domination."
}
"GLBL 339 - The Impact of War on Its (Willing and Unwilling) Participants": {
	Professor: James Hatch
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course delves into the intricate relationship between humanity and violence, whether it is state-sponsored or tribal. Students investigate the diverse impacts of armed conflict—covering physical, psychological, spiritual, and collective dimensions—while also considering the potential utilitarian benefits of collective military actions. By adopting an interdisciplinary approach, the course analyzes both historical and contemporary violent conflicts, emphasizing the experiences of civilians and combatants, as well as the often-overlooked long-term consequences of warfare. The goal is to develop a profound understanding of the human cost of war and to promote critical thinking about conflict resolution and peacebuilding. The course material is challenging and profound, addressing difficult topics such as mass violence, death, rape, child abuse, and other human tragedies. The texts highlight the brutality inflicted by political leaders and the experiences of state agents tasked with executing violence. This course is designed to explore the human experience of war with courage and conviction, ultimately guiding students toward a reflective examination of the wide-ranging human experiences associated with conflict."
}
"GLBL 348 - Identity, Culture, and Power": {
	Professor: James Sundquist
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course is less concerned with world leaders and more concerned with world citizens. How do people conceive of our international world and their place in it? Globalization and migration are challenging traditional national identities, but at the same time reawakening them. In between cosmopolitanism and nationalism lie yet more identities: when an American hangs a Ukrainian flag outside their home, are they objecting to Russia’s assault on democracy, on national sovereignty, or on a community of the West? This course explores these issues through three approaches. First, we read several classics on the construction of national identities and conceptions of the Other. We then turn to contemporary, quantitatively-inclined attempts to measure identities and trace their evolution. Finally, we look at how these concepts shape foreign policy."
}
"GLBL 357 - Contending with Israel-Palestine": {
	Professor: Robert Malley
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course takes an in-depth look at important questions surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: the parties’ competing perspectives and historical narratives; why the conflict has proved so intractable and peacemaking efforts so inadequate; why it has assumed such importance in international politics and in the United States; the status of Israel-Palestine today; internal debates regarding the conflict among Palestinians, Israelis, and Americans; the function and limits of third-party mediation; the question of media coverage; and the search for new solutions. In that sense, the course does not purport to offer a comprehensive history of the conflict, but rather a critical examination of the larger and oftentimes very difficult and emotional themes that it raises."

"GMAN 153 - Identity, Aesthetics, Activism: The Post-War German Music Video": {
	Professor: Nate Wagner
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Taught in German, this advanced-level German course examines the rich and complex legacies of identity, belonging, political participation, and social activism in the German-speaking world through the singular, ever-evolving form of the music video. Alongside background readings on the history of Germany, the German music video, and the musicians who make them, this course explores—across a wide variety of musical genres, visual styles, and social contexts—how the music video’s singular, short-form marriage of sound, text, and image suits it to depict life as it is and also to imagine how it one day might be something better. Students strengthen their reading, writing, and oral skillsets through engagement with these authentic texts and videos, in-class discussions with peers, and a variety of reflective take-home assignments. As a formally and culturally diverse medium of expression, the music video additionally prepares students to understand and reproduce phrases in the wide variety of dialects and dictions present in the world of German-speaking world and to recognize and appreciate the wide range of cultural pursuits undertaken by the communities that have come to call this region of the world their home."

"GMAN 167 - Green Germany, History and Culture of Sustainability": {
	Professor: Marion Gehlker
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Sustainability has become the defining challenge of our time. Fossil fuel overconsumption has had devastating impacts on our planet, from rapid ice melt and extreme weather to the loss of biodiversity and increased risks to human health and safety. How did we reach this critical point, and how can we move forward? We examine Germany’s longstanding environmental history from the 1900s to the present, including global initiatives and solutions. We discuss endeavors of the 1960s and 70s social justice movements, including alternative lifestyles, anti-nuclear protests, and the rise of the Green Party, but also explore topics such as the 21st-century Energiewende (energy transition), renewables, factory farming, bioethics, consumerism, housing, as well as the concepts of circularity and degrowth, sustainable banking, and fossil fuels and wars. We include local events, such as Yale's Environmental Film Series. Students will keep a weekly sustainability journal addressing world-wide solutions to these crisis as well as concrete solutions in their own lives."

"GMAN 212 - The Art of Failure": {
	Professor: Gabrielle Reid
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Everyone will fail someday, even Yale students. In this course, we read and critically analyze literature and film that exemplify failure. In today’s culture of positive thinking, dwelling on failure is considered unproductive or even harmful. But particularly in young adulthood, anything from writing a final paper to getting out of bed in the morning can feel Sisyphean. So why aren’t we talking about it? Instead of shying away from defeat, this course argues for the value of facing failure head-on. We ask questions like: What aspects of failure are inevitable parts of the human condition? What kinds of narrative arcs, vocabularies, tones, and other aesthetic choices characterize how we tell stories of failure? We begin to answer these questions with reference to exemplary failures, historical and fictional alike, and their retellings in the works they inspired. From Sisyphus’ endless struggle with the boulder to those cast as failures by society in Linklater’s film Slacker, our sources show that failure is not a mere necessary step on the road to success, nor a mistake to be avoided. Rather, it occasions the production and consumption of great art."

"GMAN 288 - The Mortality of the Soul: From Aristotle to Heidegger": {
	Professor: No professor
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course explores fundamental philosophical questions of the relation between matter and form, life and spirit, necessity and freedom, by proceeding from Aristotle's analysis of the soul in De Anima and his notion of practical agency in the Nicomachean Ethics. We study Aristotle in conjunction with seminal works by contemporary neo-Aristotelian philosophers (Korsgaard, Nussbaum, Brague, and McDowell). We in turn pursue the implications of Aristotle's notion of life by engaging with contemporary philosophical discussions of death that take their point of departure in Epicurus (Nagel, Williams, Scheffler). We conclude by analyzing Heidegger's notion of constitutive mortality, in order to make explicit what is implicit in the form of the soul in Aristotle."

"HIST 081 - Afterlives of Co-Prosperity: World War Two and Displacement Across Asia": {
	Professor: Hannah Shepherd
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The global movement of people that occurred in the aftermath of the Second World War is often evoked today. It’s used as a benchmark against which the scale and scope of the current global refugee crisis is measured. However, histories of this ‘global’ post-1945 crisis of displaced people have mainly focused on Europe, especially the aftermath of the Holocaust. This was a global war, but historical work on its aftermath for those displaced by fighting, genocidal regimes, and wartime mobilization is far less global in scope. Unlike in Europe after 1945, where, as historian Tony Judt writes, "boundaries stayed broadly intact and people were moved instead," in East Asia, "both people and boundaries moved." In this seminar, we look at the histories of the wartime and postwar movement of people in Asia, especially those mobilized or displaced by the wartime expansionist Japanese state, its colonial governments, and military forces."

"HIST 098 - Little Ice Ages: Climate Crises and Human History": {
	Professor: No professor
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Anthropogenic global warming is one of the defining crises of our time. Before the 20th century, it was cooling and drought that posed the greatest challenges to human flourishing. Temperatures could drop for centuries, such as in the Little Ice Age (ca. 1300-1850). Volcanic winters typically lasted only a year or two but rattled the ecological foundations of many societies. Through a focus on such periods of climatic disruption, this seminar serves as an introduction to the broader study of climate history. This is a rapidly developing field that combines methodologies across many disciplines, from ice core analysis and volcanology to tree rings and the analysis of written records. Our readings are often authored by multi-disciplinary teams, but our focus is on how historians understand the past interactions of human beings and the climate. The scope of the course is global and ranges from the collapse of ancient societies to the prospects for (deliberately) engineering the climate of the future. Our temporal center of gravity is the early modern period─already exquisitely documented but still highly vulnerable to changes in temperature."

	Description: "The United States was born from a revolution against an empire. Since then, one of the most cherished pieces of national mythology is that the United States, while an incredibly powerful country, has never itself been an empire. But for over a century, the United States has governed an overseas empire of colonies in the Caribbean and the Pacific. This course places the U.S. colonial empire front and center, and asks: what does U.S. history look like from the perspective of the colonies? The first part of the course looks at the origins of U.S. imperialism in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Next, we look at the pivotal year of 1898, when the United States acquired most of its colonial possessions. Lastly, we examine twentieth century struggles in the U.S. empire, including anticolonial revolutions, wars, and the unfinished project of decolonization."

"HIST 124J - Abolition in the Americas": {
	Professor: Caleb Knapp
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This seminar examines histories of slavery's abolition in the Americas. It situates the end of slavery in the United States within hemispheric and transatlantic contexts, touching upon processes of abolition in Antigua, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, and more. The course approaches abolition as a historiographical problem, considering debates about its definition, its causes and consequences, its primary agents, its periodization, and its relation to other historical processes. Questions include: How have historians defined abolition? How have they periodized it? How have scholars variously characterized the forms it took and who was responsible for it? How have they differently understood the social, cultural, economic, legal, and political conditions that gave rise to abolition? How have historians agreed and disagreed upon its effects and its aftermath? How have they framed the relation between freedom and formal emancipation? How have the communicated the stakes of their accounts of abolition? The organization of the course is topical and loosely chronological. Readings address the origins of abolition in the Atlantic world, the Haitian Revolution, processes of gradual emancipation, the historical significance of Black abolitionists, the activism of women and children, the formation and contributions of antislavery movements, the practice of moral suasion, the question of violence and antislavery militantism, antislavery discourses of rights and sexual morals, the circulation of racial and climate science in abolitionist circles, enslaved people’s practices of fugitivity, self-purchase, and revolt, the relation between capitalism and abolitionism, the Civil War, and the so-called "last abolition" of slavery in Brazil."

"HIST 129 - The Good Death: A History": {
	Professor: Deborah Streahle
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Can a death be "good" or "bad?" How so? Who gets to decide? Students in this course trace how the idea of "the good death" changed through U.S. history. Together, we consider several questions that have been used to evaluate the "goodness" of a death, asking: Is there a right time to die? Can a good death be planned? Is there a right attitude or spiritual stance to have toward death? Where does a good death take place? What kind of care is best for dying people? What should be done with dead bodies? How does grief factor into the good death?  Over the semester, students investigate both aspirational visions of the good death as well as the realities of death in U.S. history. We analyze cultural, social, and medical factors that influenced the professionalization and medicalization of death into the 21st century. In addition, students are asked to probe their own assumptions about the good death and its corollary, the good life. The course culminates in an essay that features self-reflection as well as rigorous historical analysis."

"HIST 132J - The United States and the War on Terror": {
	Professor: Michael Brenes
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The War on Terror is supposedly over, felled by an era of "great-power competition" with China. The United States’ withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, Americans were told, represented an end to "endless wars" and a shift in the foreign policy priorities of the United States away from the Middle East. What have we learned from this history, from the United States’ twenty-year War on Terror? This course aims to assess the history of the War on Terror since the 1990s and its meaning for the present.  We explore the War on Terror in both a domestic and international context. We study how the War on Terror evolved over time, how the fight against terrorism went from the priority of a few officials in the Department of Defense to dominating the major decisions made by the United States government after the terrorist attacks of September 11th. As we make our way through this history, we aim to answer the lingering question: is the War on Terror over?"

	Description: "This lecture course explores the history of eastern North America and the West Indies in the second half of the 18th century, and their relationship with British Imperial authority, in order to determine what was "revolutionary" about this history, as well as what was not. We, of course, examine the causes and consequences of the rebellion staged by thirteen of Britain's American colonies in the 1770s, but we also investigate the broader context in which these events occurred, and consider their reverberations throughout the Atlantic world as well."

"HIST 158J - Urban America in Turmoil and Transformation, 1975-Present": {
	Professor: Benjamin Schafer
	Credits: 1
	Description: "For the past half century, America’s cities have been the epicenter of crisis, confrontation, and change. From health to housing, education to entertainment, and labor to law-and-order, cities–and the people who inhabit them–have been both subjects and participants in public debates about what it means to live in modern America. While some cities became larger, more diverse, and more prosperous, others grew older, poorer, and more homogenous. Most of them fought costly drug wars, just as they bore the brunt of national economic restructuring brought on by deindustrialization and federal disinvestment. This class investigates these local and national stories, uncovering the historical roots of the vexing challenges that continue to face American cities and their citizens today. Students have the opportunity to build from classroom discussions by developing a final original research project on a topic of their choosing."

"HIST 172 - Democracy and America": {
	Professor: David Blight
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This seminar offers an inquiry into and a conversation about the conditions, practices, ideas, and beliefs that have made participatory self-government imaginable, desirable, and frustratingly difficult in the region now called the United States, from the colonial period to the present. One of its purposes is to identify urgent problems and/or questions in the history of America and democracy suitable for further research – it can be a launch pad for potential senior thesis writers.  It also offers a historical framework for thinking about critical issues in American society, politics, and government.  The course, the readings, and the weekly discussions are meant to be probative, not exhaustive.  Readings offer a mixture of primary source materials and classic secondary works across the four centuries from European colonization to the present."

"HIST 173J - The Ends of History": {
	Professor: Daniel Judt
	Credits: 1
	Description: "We encounter history every day in the world—in our families, our communities, and our politics. More than that: we use history to make all sorts of arguments, and not just ones about what really happened in the past. We appeal to historical claims to argue about questions of ethics and morality; to advocate for a particular vision of the future; to frame the present in a hopeful or foreboding light. Today in the United States, these uses of history are impossible to escape in our public, political life. Invocations of the legacies of slavery and colonization; warnings about the threat of fascism; appeals to tradition or a return to ‘better’ times: history is everywhere, and it is being put to various, and often conflicting, ends. This seminar invites students to think about the ways we can and should use the practice of history in society. Why does history matter? What can it do for us? What do we use it for, and are we using it for the right things? Is history a science, dedicated to the discovery of the real truth about the past, or is it an unending contest of different interpretations? Can it be both? To investigate these questions, we examine arguments from the recent past about the proper uses of history. Many of these arguments come from historians. We also read philosophers and social theorists, journalists and political actors, all of whom have tried to put history to use in different and conflicting ways. By exploring the ends to which we have put history in the past, we ask what we want history to do for us today."

"HIST 181J - Time Machines: Reimagining the Past": {
	Professor: John Gaddis
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course explores how representations of the past can help us to reimagine it, and thereby to "travel" there. We explore the concept of time machines and the means by which they might be–or are–constructed. This involves a quick review of the physics involved; some ways historians have used archives to reconstruct times past; the extent to which novelists complement, contradict, or complicate the work of historians; the possibility of "animating" past visual representations, whether through art, film, or computer simulation; and as individual student projects the reading of some digitally available newspaper for some particular place in some particular year."

"HIST 187J - Transnational Anti-Apartheid: The United States & South Africa": {
	Professor: No professor
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Centering the apartheid era in South Africa (1948-1994), this course unpacks the multiple ways apartheid and anti-apartheid intersected with the rise of global governance, decolonization, the Cold War, labor movements, and student movements, among other themes central to both U.S. and South African history. Through a close reading of primary and secondary sources, students examine the ways apartheid and anti-apartheid shaped the second half of the 20th century in South Africa and the United States. We grapple with a range of questions, including how transnational connections reveal new perspectives on systems of oppression and resistance in both the United States and South Africa. How did the Cold War and decolonization shape the anti-apartheid movement and African liberation movements? How did ordinary South Africans challenge apartheid? How did the U.S.-based anti-apartheid movement influence official state policy towards South Africa? Since this history is very recent, the legacies of apartheid and the transition to majority rule in 1994 are contested and continue to shape South Africa today. South Africa remains one of the most unequal nations in the world, and faces many compounding crises, including water and electricity shortages, a catastrophically high crime rate, an unrelenting AIDS crisis, and ever-rising unemployment. The enduring relevance of apartheid is evident, both in South Africa and beyond."

"HIST 191 - America From Scratch": {
	Professor: Amir Fairdosi
	Credits: 1
	Description: "What would the United States look like without a Supreme Court?  Without a Senate?  Without states?  What if the United States had ten presidents instead of one? Or no president at all?  As radical as these constitutional propositions might sound, they were all at least considered by America’s founders at the Constitutional Convention in 1787 and the state ratifying conventions that followed. In this class, we examine such proposals—proposals considered unthinkable today, but not during the Constitutional Convention and in other countries throughout history. Of each provision, we ask: why was this provision proposed at the Convention? Why was it rejected? What if America passed an amendment adopting it today?  To answer these questions, we first read the records of the Constitutional Convention, as well as documents, speeches, and letters advocating for these "radical" constitutional designs. We also examine real-world examples of how these provisions operate(d) in other contexts."

"HIST 197J - Museums: Power and Politics": {
	Professor: Elaine Ayers
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Museums are in a state of crisis. From calls for decolonization and repatriation to protests over human remains collections and unethical donor policies, museums and related cultural institutions find themselves at a crossroads, reckoning with their violent colonial histories while handling ongoing concerns about workers’ rights, systemic inequality, and their role in shaping knowledge in the public sphere. Whether addressing climate change policy, Black Lives Matter protests, fights for unionization, or Indigenous representation, it’s clear that museums are rich sites for critique in the history of science and beyond. How did we get here, and where do we go from here? Beginning with early modern cabinets of curiosity and moving through nineteenth century encyclopedic museums, controversial anatomical collections, and more recent natural history institutions, we investigate how museum politics and power produce knowledge, from the depths of their archives to sensationalized exhibits while questioning what an ethical, holistic museum might look like in the future. Amidst ongoing debates over controversial collections like the Benin Bronzes, human remains stored in universities across the United States, the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s 2023 admission of looting practices, and the American Museum of Natural History’s shallow apology for its eugenic past, the role of museums has expanded beyond the bounds of the academy, stoking universal struggles around human rights, international repatriation policies, and the politics of preservation, display, and loss. We bridge the classroom and the collection, visiting institutions around New Haven, practicing skills like provenance research and ethical handling of difficult objects while working towards a practice-based final project that suggests ways forward for museums and collections."

"HIST 206J - Britain and the French Revolution": {
	Professor: Stuart Semmel
	Credits: 1
	Description: "In this seminar, we look at British politics, society, and culture—but especially politics—during the broad period of the French revolution. Historians still disagree about just when the French revolution ended (1794? 1799? 1815?). We mostly, but not entirely, concern ourselves with Britain from 1789 until 1799. Unlike many other corners of Europe, Britain wasn’t invaded by revolutionary or Napoleonic French armies. Still, the revolution in France—which drew Britain into nearly a quarter-century of war—prompted dramatic changes in British political culture. New political organizations, both reformist and conservative, emerged. Radical arguments burst into view—and were often suppressed and prosecuted. The very vocabulary with which politics was discussed changed, in ways whose echoes are still felt today."
}
"HIST 210J - Hobbes and Galileo: Materialism and the Emergence of Modernity": {
	Professor: William Klein
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Hobbes considered himself a disciple of Galileo, but as a systematic philosopher and ideologue during a period of civil unrest in England, he no doubt produced something that Galileo, a Tuscan astrophysicist and impassioned literary critic, was not entirely responsible for: an absolutist theory of the modern state situated within an eschatological time frame. In this course we will reflect on the relation between Galileo’s anti-Aristotelian physics and Hobbes’ system by reading key texts by Galileo and Hobbes along with an array of interpretations and criticisms of Hobbes that will serve to situate Hobbes in early modern currents of thought in science, religion and politics, while at the same time situating us in contemporary ideological debates about the origins of modernity."

"HIST 240 - Sexual Minorities from Plato to the Enlightenment": {
	Professor: Igor De Souza
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This interdisciplinary course surveys the history of homosexuality from a cross-cultural, comparative  perspective. Students study contexts where homosexuality and sodomy were categorized, regulated, and persecuted and examine ancient and medieval constructions of same-sex desire in light of post-modern developments, challenging ideas around what is considered normal and/or natural. Ultimately, we ask: what has changed, and what has remained the same, in the history of homosexuality? What do gays and lesbians today have in common with pre-modern sodomites? Can this history help us ground or rethink our sexual selves and identities? Primary and secondary historical sources, some legal and religious sources, and texts in intellectual history are studied. Among the case studies for the course are ancient attitudes among Jews, early Christians, and Greeks; Christian theologians of the Middle Ages; Renaissance Florence; the Inquisition in Iberia; colonial Latin America; and the Enlightenment’s condemnation of sodomy by Montesquieu and Voltaire, and its defense by Bentham."

"HIST 257 - England and Its Empire, 1485-1783": {
	Professor: Winston Hill
	Credits: 1
	Description: "In 1485, England had just struggled through the internal Wars of the Roses, between Yorkist and Lancastrian factions. It was a medium-sized kingdom that had not even managed to control the entirety of its home island, and had a small part of Ireland as its sole overseas possession. In 1764, Great Britain had just won a decisive victory over France in the Seven Years’ War. It controlled the entirety of Britain and Ireland, possessed the second largest overseas empire in history, and was richer than any other European state. But then, in the space of the next two decades, the empire seemed to disintegrate as thirteen American colonies won their independence. This course examines how all that happened, both through the eyes of professional historians and the historical figures themselves. We are guided in this course by two critical questions: How did English monarchs, ministers, and merchants build the most effective European imperial state of its time? And what was the cost?"

"HIST 324J - World War I and the Making of the Modern Middle East": {
	Professor: Jonathan Wyrtzen
	Credits: 1
	Description: "WWI fundamentally transformed the Middle East, unmaking the Ottoman Empire and unleashing competition among colonial and local actors to reshape region’s political order that lasted well into the 1930s. This seminar examines what can be called the "Long Great War" in the Middle East. The first part examines the road to World War I and the course of the war in the Middle Eastern theater’s principle fronts (Caucasus, Mesopotamia, Sinai/Syria, North Africa, Dardanelles). We then look at the period immediately following the October 1918 Mudros Armistice (that technically ended Allied/Ottoman hostilities). During this violent "Wilsonian Moment" in the Middle East, local aspirations for self-determination were articulated, reformulated, and argued locally and internationally while colonial actors—British, French, Italian, and Spanish—mobilized competing state-building projects. The last section of the course looks at the climax points of conflict between these competing projects in the mid to late 1920s—including the Great Syrian Revolt, the Rif War, Kurdish Revolts, Saudi wars of consolidation, and the Italo-Sanusi war in Libya—and how present-day political units were finally negotiated. We conclude discussing how the Long Great War continues to echo and resonate in contemporary upheaval in the Middle East a century later."

"HIST 340J - Indigenous Oral Expression in the Americas": {
	Professor: Polly Lauer
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This writing-intensive seminar is designed for students interested in learning how to conduct research about Indigenous histories of the Western hemisphere. This course centers the place of oral communication and spoken word in articulating historical knowledge in Indigenous communities throughout the Americas. As a de-colonial methods tutorial, the class introduces students to diverse forms of spoken practice, which transports them between various geographies and regions to learn from wide-ranging Indigenous thinkers, media makers, and creators. Over the course of the semester, students immerse themselves in an auditory archive. Each week, students engage a different form of orality—poetry, song, storywork, etc.—by listening/watching/reading a primary source that is accompanied by theoretical readings. Students reckon with the politics of knowledge in historical research, considering the diversity and plurality of Indigenous identities, the significance of place and time, and the boundaries between genres. They also interrogate the limits of their own positionality and the influence of translation, while learning how to relate ethically and appropriately to sources produced by Indigenous communities. This final point is especially relevant in reading the theoretical texts—some of which are authored by non-Indigenous scholars—and in preparing students for undertaking future research."

"HIST 353 - 20th Century Japan: Empire & Aftermath": {
	Professor: No professor
	Credits: 1
	Description: "In 1905, in a victory which shocked the world, Japan defeated Imperial Russia in a regional conflict over control of Korea. To many in Asia and the non-Western world, Japan looked like a new model of anti-Western, anti-imperial modernity. However, the ensuing decades would see this image contested. The expansion of Japan’s political and economic power into East Asia over the first half of the twentieth century has shaped the region in ways still visible today. This course is split into three parts, each covering roughly two decades. First, we look at the legacies of Japan’s Meiji Restoration and the development of what has been called an "Imperial Democracy" in early 20th century Japan. Next, we look at the crises which rocked Japan in the 1930s and marked a new era. Finally,  we deal with the aftermath of empire—both in the immediate "postwar" era for Japan, and in the debates over imperial legacies and history which still reverberate in Japan and many of its former colonies today."

	Description: "This seminar takes scholars on a journey through the laws and the history of China. We encounter a series of case studies: scholarly analyses of sets of historical materials from different periods and various contexts that illustrate types of law and ways of writing history. Students read and analyze a wide variety of case materials: legal sources, trial accounts, printed records, and archival materials from different times and places in Chinese history to familiarize themselves with a range of texts used to narrate and analyze histories of law. At the same time, students familiarize themselves with materials used to study the law, and discuss and critique a diverse range of case studies written for various audiences. Working simultaneously with case materials and case studies, students become familiar with both the range of sources and the variety of methods used to study law and history in China."

"HIST 406 - Psychology and Global Capitalism": {
	Professor: Tariq Khan
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course examines the historical relationship between the development of the psychological sciences and the development of global capitalism. Students grapple with primary and secondary sources which prompt them to think critically about the past and present of psychology and the ways in which the psychological sciences served the interests of, shaped, and were shaped by dominant economic and political systems. Students study the historical relationship between the "mind sciences" and the intertwined systems of capitalism, imperialism, and white supremacy from the 17th century to the present. Students also examine the role some psychologists and related scientists and scholars have played in challenging and resisting those same intertwined systems and institutions. This course is interdisciplinary in that, in addition to studying works by psychologists, students will study, analyze, and critique works in other fields–such as history, anthropology, ethnic studies, and postcolonial studies–which are relevant to understanding the historical development of global capitalism and the psychological sciences."

"HIST 412J - The Psalms, A Cultural History of Ancient Prayer": {
	Professor: Stephen Davis
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course introduces students to the Book of Psalms and its significant cultural and religious impact in ancient Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The course is organized in three units. Unit 1 focuses on the text of the Psalms, with special attention to their literary forms, editorial organization, and early ritual context in ancient Israel. Unit 2 focuses on the reception and use of the Psalms in late ancient Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, with special attention to matters of translation, interpretation, worship, prayer, and scriptural authority. Unit 3 focuses on material and sensory encounters with the Psalms from antiquity to the present day within these three religious traditions—case studies related to tactile and visual contact with the physical book, oral and aural engagement through song or chant, and embodied forms of writing, reciting, and enacting the Psalms in the context of ritual practice, including magical spells. The goal of the course is thus to trace the life and afterlife—to write the textual and extra-textural "biography," as it were—of a major biblical book."

"HIST 417J - Science Fiction and Prediction: Histories of Utopia, Apocalypse, and the Future": {
	Professor: Elizabeth O'Neil
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Climate catastrophe. AI Singularity. Viral mutation. Mars colonization. Everywhere you look today, scientists, journalists, and regular social media users are making predictions about the future. Throughout this course, we take a historical approach to how scientists and science fiction writers have tried to predict the future – or bring about a better one – using the rhetoric and cultural authority of science. Embracing the fuzzy boundaries of between science fiction and science prediction, we survey a variety of speculative utopian plans, dystopian nightmares, and apocalyptic visions of the future, along with secondary literature from historians and scholars of literature. How and why have scientists and scientific ideas been imagined as resources for solving social problems? How can we use predictions about the future to understand the past? This seminar appeals to students interested in the history of science and medicine, literature, politics, technology, and environmental studies."

"HIST 419 - History of Psychology: Racism and Colonial Power": {
	Professor: Tariq Khan
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course introduces students to the history of psychology with a focus on racism and colonial power embedded in the "mind sciences." Students grapple with primary and secondary sources which prompt them to think critically about the past and present of psychology and the ways in which systems of race, gender, and class inequality interact with major institutions, systems, and research practices. Students study the historical relationship between the "mind sciences" and the intertwined systems/institutions of white supremacy/racial hierarchy, cisheteropatriarchy, capitalism, empire, and colonialism from the 17th century to the present. Students also examine the role some psychologists and related scientists and scholars have played in challenging and resisting those same intertwined systems and institutions. This course is interdisciplinary in that, in addition to studying works by psychologists, students study, analyze, and critique works in other fields–such as history, anthropology, ethnic studies, and postcolonial studies–which are relevant to understanding the historical development of the psychological sciences."

"HIST 427J - Health, Surveillance, and Refugee Politics": {
	Professor: Gourav Krishna Nandi
	Credits: 1
	Description: "How have states historically determined which bodies deserve asylum and care and which can be exposed to deportation, detention, and violence? How have colonial depictions of Asia and Africa as racialized geographies continued to shape migration policies and humanitarian practices throughout the twentieth century? In this seminar, we explore how states and humanitarian actors have utilized technologies of surveillance and control to govern the lives and movements of migrants and refugees throughout the twentieth century. We consider the multifarious reasons why communities, especially throughout Asia, have been mobile since the beginning of the nineteenth century and how this mobility has been shaped through colonial biomedical regimes. Critically interrogating Western images of Global South refugees seeking asylum in the Global North, we investigate contemporary gendered and racialized images of the "good refugee" or migrant who "deserve" consideration in the modern humanitarian system through biomedical categories. Students are expected to apply historical insights to contemporary debates surrounding surveillance, citizenship, and the global migration regime, challenging prevailing narratives and exploring alternative perspectives on refugee surveillance regimes."

From the food that we eat to our growing obsession with houseplants, from the pharmaceutical industry to recent meditations on queerness and reproductive freedom, plants are inescapable, offering both practical and metaphoric roots, tendrils, and blossoming ideas about our own bodies and our engagement within changing social, political, and cultural structures. This course considers the ways that plants (and fungi) have shaped ideas about gender, sexuality, race, health, medicine, capitalism, power, and consciousness from the early modern period to the present, moving chronologically to examine our complicated relationships with the natural world. Working within the (broadly construed and ongoing) colonial context, we follow plants and their collectors, cultivators, and stewards across oceans and continents, charting the rise of plantation agriculture and specious ways of classifying species to twentieth-century focuses on breeding and genetics, attempts to patent plants as medicines, and, in recent years, calls to use plants as models for new (or, perhaps, very old) models for kinship that upturn these very systems of power."

	Professor: No professor
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "Plants weave their way into every aspect of our lives. From the food that we eat to our growing obsession with houseplants, from the pharmaceutical industry to recent meditations on queerness and reproductive freedom, plants are inescapable, offering both practical and metaphoric roots, tendrils, and blossoming ideas about our own bodies and our engagement within changing social, political, and cultural structures. This course considers the ways that plants (and fungi) have shaped ideas about gender, sexuality, race, health, medicine, capitalism, power, and consciousness from the early modern period to the present, moving chronologically to examine our complicated relationships with the natural world. Working within the (broadly construed and ongoing) colonial context, we follow plants and their collectors, cultivators, and stewards across oceans and continents, charting the rise of plantation agriculture and specious ways of classifying species to twentieth-century focuses on breeding and genetics, attempts to patent plants as medicines, and, in recent years, calls to use plants as models for new (or, perhaps, very old) models for kinship that upturn these very systems of power."

"HLTH 327 - Critical Thinking in Global Health Practice": {
	Professor: Kristina Talbert-Slagle
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The practice of global health involves thousands of people and millions of dollars around the world. But what, exactly, is global health practice? Who is doing it? How is it done? Where? And why? In this course, we examine and critique the who, what, when, where, why, and how of global health practice. Course content interweaves broadly-focused theory, examination, and critique of global health practice with specific examples and first-person accounts from the lived experiences of the professor and her longtime collaborators in Liberia. The learning experiences provided by this course lies not only in discussion of the assigned materials, but also in self-examination throughout the semester as we collectively reflect on both the course content and our own reactions to it. Students enrolling in this course must commit to engage thoroughly in the material and in the critical thinking and discussion that are necessary for their learning, and they should be willing to challenge the professor and each other constructively as part of the "critical thinking" component of the course. (We work together to make a safe and comfortable space for this.)"

"HSAR 160 - Art and Technology": {
	Professor: Pamela Lee
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This global introductory course broadly surveys the relationship between art and technology from parietal art (the art of prehistoric caves and rock art) to the rise of NFTs ("non-fungible tokens") within contemporary digital culture. Departing from the notion of "techne" as craftsmanship or art, we consider the ways in which the history of art is always informed by histories of technology; and that histories of technology are often advanced through practices of art making. Topics include technologies for representing space in European and Asian painting and the centrality of Arab science in the development of linear perspective during the Renaissance; histories of textiles as data storage before the advent of the computer; the cybernetic revolution and the rise of computers; biometrics and surveillance; machine learning and art without artists. Objects include textiles, sculpture, painting, prints, photography and video, as well as sound, digital platforms and AI-generated artifacts. The course aims to de-center triumphal and universalist notions of technological achievement and ideologies of "progress" that inform contemporary cultures of media and technology. We pay special attention to the interests of race and gender throughout the semester. This course is open to all, including those with no prior background in art history. Sections may include visits to collections and sites across Yale campus."

"HSAR 491 - The Artist in African Art and Ethics of Display": {
	Professor: James Green
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course offers the opportunity to think about the role of the artist in different African societies by closely engaging with the Yale University Art Gallery’s important collection of African art. Considering specialists in a variety of different media, including ceramics, metalwork, painting, textiles, and wooden sculpture from across the continent we reflect on the degree to which knowledge of a maker’s identity may inform our understanding of a work of art–or not as the case may be. The critical analysis of objects introduces students to the idea of artworks as original documents, and throughout the course, students are introduced to many aspects of museum practice with a particular focus on the development of the forthcoming fall 2022 exhibition Bámigbóyè: A Master Sculptor of the Yorùbá Tradition. Central to this seminar is an engagement with curatorial practice and the ethics surrounding the display of art from Africa in an American museum. Guest speakers include educators, conservators, artists, and curators who help us to interrogate the decisions that inform how African art is displayed in museums today."

"HSHM 206 - Body Politics: Histories of American Reproductive Rights, Health, and Activism from 1800": {
	Professor: No professor
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "Are all politics reproductive politics? This course traces the reproductive history of the United States from the early nineteenth century to the present day. Questions about reproduction–and about not reproducing–are deeply tied to questions of gendered and racial rights; of bodily autonomy; of American expansion and empire; and of who counts as a citizen, or even as a human being. In the past few years, we’ve encountered new stories about everything from new and restrictive abortion laws, to immigrant woman who were sterilized without their consent, to new technologies in male birth control, to the inequitable childcare burden that falls to women during times of hardship, to the racist roots of foster care and residential school systems. In this course, we come to understand the historical changes in American reproduction to better understand the complicated roots of our current moment. By analyzing articles in newspapers and scientific journals, advertisements, film, patient and physician narratives, and exhibitions and material culture, students will understand reproduction as a site for empowerment and activism, as a site of medical professionalization, and as a site of health disparity. We examine reproduction capaciously, including pregnancy and childbirth, birth control and abortion, assistive reproductive technologies, and adoption and foster care. Our analysis is intersectional, and we consider what different identities meant for reproduction historically, as well as in our current moment."

"HUMS 031 - Bilingual Imaginaries: Thinking, Writing, and Living across Languages": {
	Professor: Jane Mikkelson
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course examines what it means to exist in more than one language. For some, another language might be natively known, or laboriously acquired to the point of fluency in adult years; others may live with a second language that has been partially lost, suppressed, or broken (and perhaps later revived and reclaimed). We read poems, plays, short stories, and novels in which various proficiencies in another language are met with restlessness, exuberance, anxiety, humor, and ingenuity. Thinking about how language and identity are bound together in vital and surprisingly elastic ways, we consider how knowledge of a second language can impress itself on the imagination, on literature—even on one’s very sense of self. This course helps students acquire critical reading and writing skills, with a particular focus on close reading, textual analysis, formulating academic arguments, and essay-writing."

"HUMS 148 - The Quran and its Interpreters": {
	Professor: Shawkat Toorawa
	Credits: 1
	Description: "We spend the first third of the course reading the Quran, studying its written compilation and redaction; its narrative structure; its rhetorical strategies; its major themes; its connections to and departures from other Scripture; translation and the problems associated with it. In the next two thirds we engage with the rich tradition of commentary, exegesis, and interpretation it has occasioned—legal, literary, theological, and visual, from classical readings and materials all the way up to the modern period and present day. We also look at the ways the Quran has been interpreted in different media, notably the visual arts. We pay special attention to certain surahs (chapters), including The Heifer (2, Baqarah), Joseph (12, Yusuf), The Cave (18, Kahf), Ya Sin (36), and several prominent short surahs. Topics include the Devil; Jesus and Mary; Moses and the Children of Israel; the nature of the Divine; the status of women and men; the impact of the Qur’an on political and religious thought; and its influence of the Qur’an on literature."
}
"HUMS 161 - Columbus to Google: A Critical History of the Archive": {
	Professor: Alexander Gil Fuentes
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Modern libraries and archives cannot be understood without steady reference to the history of European conquest and colonial expansion. In the 21st century, we are as likely to mourn its evident gaps and silences as to rejoice in its feats of accumulation. Scholars today train to read between the lines, against the grain, even to critically fabulate in order to be able to reconstruct the lived world and knowledges lost in the wake of European genocide and erasure. Not far from his father’s desire to conquer, Ferdinand Columbus imagined and went out of his way to build a universal library of all that could be known. We begin our course here, at the encounter, when cosmography and bibliography collapse into each other, driven by the Euro-Christian will to conquer. We end in the present, when companies like Google, Microsoft, and other specific actors have gained enormous power through their ability to aggregate and index massive corpora; now, when the cultural and historical record of humanity has become a hybrid construct, part analog, part digital; but also when generative AI begins to make its independent contributions to that very record. Instead of tracing a prefabricated history of libraries and archives, we will revisit key episodes, tropes, ideas and practices from the past 500 years in order to investigate how the de-facto archive of humanity came to be the way it is today. We will also encourage each other to imagine new ways of understanding how the human record is not only a simple byproduct of human activity, but often produces and frames that very activity, helping us connect our historical and theoretical sketches to contemporary concerns: the Anthropocene, the corporate threat to research and education, persistent inequalities and more."

"HUMS 389 - Ecstasy": {
	Professor: Riley Soles
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course explores the structure and role of ecstasy in a variety of religious and literary contexts, from ancient Greek beliefs and practices to modern American poetry and postmodern theory. Ecstasy derives from the Greek ekstasis, meaning "to stand outside (of oneself)," and the term has been used in various cultural and historical contexts to describe modes of experiential and intellectual transcendence in traditions of ritual, mysticism, performance, hermeneutics, literary theory and criticism, poetry, and poetics. The course takes primarily structural, psychological, and phenomenological approaches to the topics of ecstasy and the ecstatic in religion and literature, in order to think through what ecstasy "is," when and why it happens, what it achieves, and how it does so. The course explores the relationship between ecstasy and other religious categories such as doctrine, praxis, ethics, faith, and service. Likewise, we locate ecstasy as a major element in poetic traditions, and its relationship to metaphor, poetic influence, demonic possession, and the Sublime."

"ITAL 154 - Contemporary Italian Culture": {
	Professor: Federica Parodi
	Credits: 1
	Description: "What does it mean for poetry to be part of our everyday life, to the point that we make poetry without even realizing it? Can poetry ignite revolutions? What role does it play in shaping political discourse? This course will explore these questions by tracing the evolution of Italian poetry and its political engagements from the radical experimentation of Futurism to the protest movements of the 1960s and beyond. Through close readings of texts, manifestos, songs, radio broadcasts, graffiti and performances, we will explore how radical aesthetics influenced the politics of protest, how the language of Futurism persisted into the 1970s, and how poetry became a tool for political expression in movements against fascism, neoliberalism, and capitalist oppression. The course includes visits to the Beinecke Library and the Yale Art Gallery, as well as the bindery, where students will have the opportunity to learn some basic techniques of printing and bookbinding. For the final project, students will create their own artistic expressions that reflect on the interplay between art and activism, drawing inspiration from the course themes and their experiences during these site visits."

Through an interdisciplinary lens—primarily historical and anthropological—we examine how Indigenous groups have navigated their relationships with the Colonial and Mexican state, and have resisted exploitation, depravation, and homogenization policies. Special attention will be given to the ways in which indigenous peoples resisted colonization, adapted to (or controlled) imposed national identities, and fought for the defense of their lands, natural resources, security, and cultural identities in modern times. The Mexican Revolution, the rise of indigenismo policies, the Zapatistas and the Cherán movements, among others critical social developments, are analyzed. We also address the impact of neoliberal policies, migration, and organized crime on indigenous communities since the 1980s, alongside international influences. By the end of the course, students develop a comprehensive understanding of the historical and contemporary struggles of Mexican indigenous groups and their broader significance in Mexico’s society."

}
"LING 232 - Phonology I": {
	Professor: Natalie Weber
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Why do languages sound distinct from one another? Partly it is because different languages use different sets of sounds (in spoken languages) or signs (in signed languages) from one another. But it is also because those sounds and signs have different distributional patterns in each language. Phonology is the study of the systematic organization and patterning of sounds and signs. Students learn to describe the production of sounds and signs (articulatory phonetics), discuss restrictions on sound and sign distribution (morphemic alternation, phonotactics), and develop a model of the phonological grammar in terms of rules and representations. Throughout the course, we utilize datasets taken from a variety of the world’s languages."

For instance, we can acquire a language from a small amount of data - thousands of times less data than current systems in artificial intelligence - and we can infer what another person means even when that person’s intended message goes beyond the literal meaning of their words. This course explores how computational modeling can help us characterize our incredible capacity for language learning and processing. We focus on three modeling traditions - symbolic algorithms, Bayesian models, and neural networks - and their application to a range of psycholinguistic phenomena, including parsing, pragmatics, speech perception, word learning, and language acquisition. We also discuss how artificial intelligence can inform theories of human language processing and vice versa."

	Description: "Matters of personal and group identity underpin the development of science as a discipline, the lived experience of its practitioners, and the achievement of excellence by diverse cultures collaborating on research, teaching in schools, treating the sick, promoting business, and setting government policy. Yale STEM students who are actively engaged in the study of any aspect of identity and society, whether contemporary or historical, learn how STEM is intertwined with these interests. To achieve this goal, students in this course must be simultaneously enrolled in a full-credit, humanities course at Yale. Instructor permission is required and is based on a proposal (250 words) that makes a compelling case for exploring STEM’s engagement with the concurrent humanities course. Students use knowledge from the humanities course to develop a unique project that can include anecdotal sources, but must also include elements of formal scholarship learned in class. Primary scientific literature and publicly available data relevant to students’ projects in any given semester are engaged and discussed during seminar-styled class meetings. Dissemination of projects take several forms including one appropriate for the public or popular press, a flash talk presentation open to the Yale community, and lastly a formal term-paper."

Acknowledging the capacity of music to activate and influence autonomic system responses, this course involves research into music’s medicinal properties on the human mind. An integral part of the course, the "sound-lab" teaches students the methods of guided listening using Rāgs (Indian melodic systems). Such methods involve techniques including structural breathing and yogic postures, as they pertain to connecting the art of rituals and health care. Through the lens of ethnomusicology, the topics extend the listening part of the lab to draw comparisons and analyze music and healing practices from a variety of religions in South Asia and beyond. The overall goal of the course is to enable students with the tools of music and healing."

	Description: "Throughout the long nineteenth century, opera was the most expensive, lavish, and politically implicated multimedia spectacle, with both its production and the act of opera-going offering prime opportunities to negotiate personal and collective identities. By looking at all of opera’s complex media—libretti, music, voice types, design, stage technology, architecture, etc.—this seminar addresses various forms and techniques of representation related to such issues as gender, sexuality, class, race, nationalism, (dis)ability, the rise of the masses as a political agent, and the operatic genre itself as a vehicle of colonialism. Each week focuses on one topic and opera (or scenes), including works by Rossini, Weber, Meyerbeer, Verdi, Wagner, Puccini, Smyth, and Gershwin, as well as their representation on today’s stages. We may contrast these historical works with developments in contemporary opera. A visit to the Metropolitan Opera or other performance(s) is anticipated (if possible)."

"MUSI 483 - The Gospel Imagination: Tradition and Revolution": {
	Professor: Braxton Shelley
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course attends to the rebels who shaped the history of Black gospel music. Navigating social and political forces like the Great Migration and Black Consciousness, while weaving Black sacred tradition together with blues and hip-hop, figures like Thomas Dorsey, Sallie Martin, Mahalia Jackson, Rosetta Tharpe, Edwin Hawkins, and Kirk Franklin all understood themselves to be revolutionaries of sorts—an identity that brought with it both peril and possibility. Tracing this revolutionary thread through gospel’s history, this course attends to gospel’s distinctive combination of sound and belief through three interpretive lenses: exemplary performers, pivotal periods, and formal processes. This semester’s work brings material and approaches from the fields of musicology, music theory, ethnomusicology, black studies, homiletics, and theology to bear on three questions: 1) What work—musical, cultural, and spiritual—does gospel do for its various audiences? 2) How does the function of the gospel song shape its form? 3) What forms of resistance has gospel music rendered—within the church and outside it? Students immerse themselves in these dimensions of the "the gospel imagination" through a combination of weekly reading, listening and writing assignments, all of which culminates in a final composition project that will be workshopped in a masterclass with a leading gospel artist."

"NSCI 479 - Computational Basis of Seeing and Thinking": {
	Professor: Ilker Yildirim
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This seminar aims to discuss the computational basis of seeing and thinking in the mind and brain. The course be organized around three central questions in brain and cognitive sciences. First, we start with this question of how perception gets us to cognition: How is it that perception transforms raw, unstructured incoming sensory signals arising from our physical environments -- the light that bounces off surfaces and arrives at the retina, raw audio waves hitting the ears, or the vibro-tactile sensations felt at the fingertips when touching a surface -- into things like objects, scenes, events, and agents, into things that we can think about? We draw upon readings and classroom discussions, primarily computational literature, to explore representational and algorithmic hypothesis about seeing and thinking in the mind. Second, we observe that these cognitive hypotheses about mental representations are typically developed in rather sterile, or as scientists we like to call it "controlled", settings. We proceed to ask how these cognitive hypotheses about mental representations can be scaled to the messiness and complexity of the real world. This leads us to issues at the intersection of AI, psychology, and cognitive science. Finally, we observe that in most cases, cognitive representations about mental representations don't plausibly or at least readily map onto a brain implementation. So, we ask: How is it that through the distributed and dynamic activity in our brain’s neural circuits, we come to think thoughts about objects and agents, mentally simulate what will happen next, and plan actions accordingly? We explore multi-level theories of intelligence, that make bridges across AI, neuroscience and cognitive science."

"PHIL 022 - Philosophy of Masculinities": {
	Professor: Robin Dembroff
	Credits: 1
	Description: "What is masculinity? What relationships does it bear to femininity, misogyny, and homophobia? To race? To biological sex? This course examines these and other questions related to masculinity from a philosophical perspective. The course develops students’ understanding of masculinity as a cultural product that changes across context and time. It pays particular attention to the ways that masculinity is socially policed and reinforced, rather than a "natural" expression of male sex. Through combinations of academic and popular texts, students critically examine language surrounding masculinity (e.g., "real man", "bromance"), interlocking relationships between masculinity and other social features, such as race/ethnicity and class, social mechanisms that reproduce masculine norms (e.g., misogyny), and forces that challenge these norms (e.g., trans and queer identifications). From this groundwork, students consider the influence of masculinity on main fields of philosophy, such as epistemology, philosophy of science, ethics, and metaphysics, as well as the prospects for non-hierarchical, non-"toxic" forms of masculinity."

"PHIL 317 - Agency in Social Structures": {
	Professor: Anne Quaranto
	Credits: 1
	Description: "We have strong intuitions—based on our experience as agents—that we can, at least sometimes, act freely. Our practices of ascribing moral responsibility also presuppose this possibility, insofar as we consider threats or duress to mitigate responsibility. Yet many of our interpersonal activities are only possible within particular social institutions and practices, which both constrain and enable our agency. What is it, then, to act freely, creatively, or responsibly within social structures that are not in any individual agent's control? In this course, we tackle this apparent tension between social determination and agency. To do so, we consider what social structures are and what it is to act in these structures. As we survey some of the accounts of social institutions and practices offered by philosophers, anthropologists, and sociologists, we focus on three broad questions: What does it take to act freely within the social structures that shape our agency? How might novel or creative forms of action act on the structures themselves? And what's required for an agent to be responsible, not just for the immediate consequences of their actions, but for the functioning of a given structure to which they're contributing? For instance, when is an agent complicit in the oppressive functions of a certain social practice?"

"PHIL 323 - The Frankfurt School": {
	Professor: No professor
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The Frankfurt School of Critical Theory was (is) a group of eclectic interdisciplinary Marxist philosophers and social scientists, active from the 1920s to the present. Most were German Jews born around the turn of the 20th century. The Frankfurt school were a group of thinkers in almost perpetual exile. Simultaneously critical of American capitalism and of Soviet Communism, they were expelled from their native Germany in the wake of Hitler’s rise to power. They also often lacked any intellectual safe haven, finding themselves at odds much philosophical and social-scientific orthodoxy (positivism, neo-Kantianism, "value-free" social science etc.). The critical theorists of the Frankfurt School sought to re-actualize ideas from the philosophical tradition, especially from Kant and Hegel, in order to address the complex realities of modern society: mass culture; fascism, totalitarianism and authoritarianism; world war; imperialism; secularization; irrationality, sexuality and aggression; and so on. This class looks at critical theory from a philosophical perspective, focusing on its claim to fuse traditional philosophy and radical social science."

The goal of this graduate/advanced undergraduate seminar is to introduce students to the different types of conflict and political violence in Russia and post-Soviet spaces, their causes, forms, and impact. The class will show continuities between Russia’s involvement in conflicts in Chechnya, Syria, and Ukraine. At the same time, the class will attempt to decenter Russia and explore interconnected conflicts in the post-Soviet space, including Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia, and Tajikistan. We will explore how local actors shaped Russian security policies in the so-called "near abroad" and globally. The class will present the key research on various aspects of violence, will discuss the similarities and differences between types and forms of violence, and will analyze the different theoretical and methodological approaches to studying violence in the region. We will also discuss the impact of violence on the societies and the people of the region."

"RLST 293 - Reform and Continuity in Islamic law": {
	Professor: No professor
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course aims to provide students with an alternative reading of the Islamic legal tradition. It upends the view that Islamic law was in some way allergic to change. Likewise, it problematizes the notion that the medieval legal tradition either lacked innovation or was rendered obsolete by colonial reforms and modernist critique. It approaches Islamic law through the speculative enterprise of jurisprudence (fiqh), the work of legal scholars to elaborate God’s most likely position regarding any legal dilemma. Through the literature and opinions (fatwās) of legal specialists from the ninth through the twentieth century, the class interrogates the relationship between change and continuity in Islamic law. We explore how jurisconsults balanced the doctrine of trans-regional schools of law with the local dilemmas faced by the communities in which they lived and served. Similarly, we consider not only the opportunities but also the risks that arise from adapting Islamic law to local conditions. The course challenges students to ask what is change within a tradition? In the debates and polemics of legal scholars, we contemplate the appeal and the limitations of reform within Islamic law, tracing how both have been contested and have evolved across different geographies and periods in the Muslim World. Likewise, we rethink the boundaries of continuity. We question how a legal school and a legal canon are constructed and revised, examining the ways in which both are capable of reinforcing – or imperiling – the Islamic legal tradition. Last, we explore the endurance of Islamic law in contemporary Muslim societies. The course reflects on the processes and the consequences of various projects of "modernizing" the Sharīʿa, asking how the institutions of the colonial and postcolonial state have reconfigured Islamic law in radically different ways."

"RSEE 401 - Socialist Realism And Its Legacies": {
	Professor: No professor
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Socialist Realism was promulgated in the 1930s as the sole mode for cultural production in the Soviet Union. Since that time, it has been maligned as totalitarian, lauded as emancipatory, dismissed as hackish, and reappropriated in a variety of ways–from homage to parody. This course offers an introduction to Socialist Realism and its legacies, beginning with its prehistory in the early Soviet avant-garde and other cultural movements, tracing its official adoption under Stalin, its reassessment in the late Soviet period, and its legacies after the fall of the Soviet Union. Special attention is paid to the interpretations of Socialist Realism in the emerging national cultures beyond the Russian SFSR. The course also examines select examples of the impact of Socialist Realism beyond the Soviet Union, particularly in the "Third World" during the era of Cold War cultural diplomacy. Questions for discussion include: How did Socialist Realism imagine, enforce, and unsettle hierarchies of gender, race, and ethnicity? What did Socialist Realism look like beyond literature–in film, visual art, architecture, and music? How did the imperative to use Socialist Realism connect to the Soviet project to create minority cultures that would be "national in form, socialist in content"?  How did people outside the Second World receive and appropriate Socialist Realism?"

	Description: "When attempting to solve many social problems, good intentions are not enough. It is necessary to understand the interdependencies and secondary consequences of action. This class is premised on the idea that there is often (not necessarily always) an underlying structural aspect to social problems and that understanding the structural aspect can improve our ability to successfully deal with these problems. Everyone sees the forest, but it is harder to see the roots. We are going to try to see the roots of social processes–not in the sense of origins but instead in the way in which they are interconnected. The issues covered by the class are relevant to policy making, law, activism, governance, and management."

We also explore key themes such as neocolonialism, decolonization, gender and sexual politics, racism, violence, human rights, indigenous movements, and environmental crises. The objective is not to present a periodized narrative of events or causally linked sources, but rather to offer representative examples of key historical transitions through cultural and political artifacts. By the end of the course, students have gained a solid understanding of the historical past and the contemporary debates that shape the Latin American region."

	Professor: Alexandra Vazquez
	Credits: 1
	Description: "What is play?  Can it be taught? And what is performance’s fundamental bond to play and creativity? This course explores performance and its relationship to play through novels, drama, poetry, theoretical readings, music, and puppet theater.  Students read classic works in psychoanalytic theory, anthropology, dramatic theory, and philosophy to imagine how artistic practices can offer a return to a "childlike" state of play and wonder.  Taking play seriously and seriousness playfully, this course also considers what "having fun" might feel like in the contemporary moment.  Throughout the semester, students work on a multimedia project that incorporates the course’s key concepts into their own theorizations of play"
}
"TBTN 160 - Advanced Classical Tibetan II": {
	Professor: No professor
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This is the second half of the two-semester class that is designed to assist students who already have the equivalent of at least two-years of Classical Tibetan language study. The course is intended to build on this foundation so that students gain greater proficiency in reading a variety of classical Tibetan writing styles and genres, including texts relevant to their research. The course readings focus primarily on texts written during the Ganden Phodrang period up through the 19th century. Over the two semesters, the class covers three sets of  materials: 1) famous or otherwise influential classical works (mostly historical, some literary); 2) important historical texts that have come to light in recent years but are scarcely known in western scholarship; and 3) classical language texts that support the research needs of the enrolled students. Classical Tibetan grammar and other conventions are identified and discussed in the course of the readings. Depending on student interest, we will draw from a range of historical and literary genres: poetry (snyan ngag), biographies (rnam thar), avadanas (rtogs brjod), religious histories (chos ’byung), administrative documents (gzhung yig), epistolary writings (e.g. chab shog), etc. Students also gain facility in kāvya-derived ornamental vocabulary and rhetorical devices."

"THST 085 - Anatomy and Movement": {
	Professor: Renee Robinson
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course traces connections between the study of  human anatomy and dance practices of the late 20th century to the present. Over the past century, a group of pioneering practitioners sought to combine advances in human anatomical and neuromuscular science with the felt, practically applied knowledge of dance artists. Their research has spawned an array of new methods for training dance and theater artists, including ideokinesis, somatics, and body-mind centering. Immersing students in a studio-based, practical exploration, this course introduces students to key ideas and thinkers in the field of dance science.  Major topics include the study of functional and kinesthetic anatomy; the neuromuscular reeducation of alignment, posture and balance; the use of imagery as a motivator of movement; and the cultivation of enhanced mind-body awareness through physical practice. 

No prior experience in dance or theater necessary. This course is open to students of all physical abilities and backgrounds. The instructor will work with students with special needs or specific physical disabilities to adapt the movement exercises to meet their capabilities."
}
"THST 093 - Creativity, Devising, and the Art of Making Theater": {
	Professor: Hal Brooks
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Within theater, there is always an initial spark of creation, whether it initiates from the playwright, a group of improvisers, or a combination of playwright and a troupe of actors. This course focuses on how to investigate, analyze, replicate and catalyze that impulse. It sources many art forms as a window into how we create, and attempts to address how artists begin to move from idea to execution. What is creativity? Is it innate? Is it a skill that can be developed? How? What happens when two or more people are involved in that pursuit of creation? Which techniques are common across disciplines? And how might a theater artist learn about creative pursuits from artists in other disciplines including music, design, and fiction as well as theater? Students from all backgrounds and interests will delve into techniques, identifying and integrating habits that foster creativity, creating their own works over the semester, both in small and larger groups, in solo and group projects."

"THST 383 - A History of Directing": {
	Professor: David Chambers
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course is designed not only for directors, but also for actors, writers, designers, and anyone interested in modern Western theatre and cultural history. The weekly plan (see Canvas) displays the intention to survey the art of theatre-directing and consequent acting techniques from humble origins in the mid 19th century to today’s brilliant international practitioners. We concentrate on innovative and highly influential directors from six countries, one nation at a time, as they emerge from their homeland’s theatrical and cultural context into national and often international prominence. The course is conceived as a practicum: deep seminar-style reading and video research, student presentations, and critical discussion will be followed by on-the-floor experiential embodiments, activating performance techniques gleaned from the artist(s) surveyed that day. As collateral benefits, students are exposed to a wide range of plays and some extraordinary theatrical design. Students should not only accrue knowledge in this course, but ideally find inspiration leading to creative action – and maybe even a bit of soul – as they prepare to make and/or watch theatre at Yale and beyond."

It includes an examination of the political, social, economic, and aesthetic events that led to its beginnings and follows the journey of its passionate creativity and diversity of expression, as well as the political upheavals and the cultural revolution that were inextricable a part of it. We begin with its roots in the Beat Generation, Abstract Expressionism in art, the innovations of Gertrude Stein, the poetry of Allen Ginsberg, Happenings, and then move on to study, among others, The Living Theatre, The Open Theatre, The Performance Group, the Ontological-Hysteric Theatre, The Ridiculous Theatrical Company, Mabou Mines, The Bread and Puppet Theatre, and The Wooster Group. This period of theatre was an important one for world theatre. Not only were the artists creating new forms that then found their way into mainstream Western theatre, many of the techniques, styles and impulses of this work originated in India and the East. My hope is that this course inspires the students to discover the depths of their own unique artistry."

"AFAM 522 - The Beautiful Struggle: Blackness, the Archive, and the Speculative": {
	Professor: Daphne Brooks
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This seminar takes its inspiration from concepts and questions centering theories that engage experimental methodological approaches to navigating the opacities of the archive: presumptively "lost" narratives of black life, obscure(d) histories, compromised voices and testimonials, contested (auto)biographies, anonymous testimonies, textual aporias, fabulist documents, confounding marginalia. The scholarly and aesthetic modes by which a range of critics and poets, novelists, dramatists, and historians have grappled with such material have given birth to new analytic lexicons—from Saidiya Hartman’s "critical fabulation" to José Estaban Muñoz’s "ephemera as evidence" to Tavia Nyong’o’s "Afrofabulation." Such strategies affirm the centrality of speculative thought and invention as vital and urgent forms of epistemic intervention in the hegemony of the archive and open new lines of inquiry in black studies. Our class explores a variety of texts that showcase these new queries and innovations, and we also actively center our efforts from within the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, where a number of sessions are held and where we focus on Beinecke holdings that resonate with units of the course. Various sessions also feature distinguished guest interlocutors via Zoom, who are on hand to discuss the specifics of their research methods and improvisational experimentations in both archival exploration and approaches to their prose and poetic projects."

"AFAM 695 - The Study of African American Music": {
	Professor: Braxton Shelley
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This seminar explores the musical objects, critical debates, and scholarly methodologies that have shaped the study of African American music. How do artists, critics, and theorists differently define "Black music"? How do competing conceptions of Black musical traditions reflect and resist commercial and academic modes of categorization? In this course, we attend to the intersections and divergences that emerge from myriad attempts to define and discipline the musical products of black experience, converting Blues, Funk, Gospel, Hip-Hop, House, Jazz, Reggae, R&B, Soca, Soul, the Spiritual, and many other idioms, into a single knowledge-object. We investigate the intellectual genealogies and scholarly disagreements that arise from the interdisciplinary scope of Black music studies, including: cultural history, cultural studies, ethnomusicology, literary studies, historical musicology, music theory, sociology, and theology. Required for students in the Joint Ph.D. Program in Music and African American Studies, this reading-intensive graduate course brings together texts that have defined the interdisciplinary study of Black music and new work that is remaking the field."

"AMST 697 - Michel Foucault II: The Works, the Interlocutors, The Critics": {
	Professor: Greta LaFleur
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Continuing graduate-level course presents students with the opportunity to develop a thorough, extensive, and deep (though still not exhaustive!) understanding of the oeuvre of Michel Foucault, and his impact on late-twentieth-century criticism and intellectual history in the United States. Non-francophone and/or U.S. American scholars, as Lynne Huffer has argued, have engaged Foucault’s work unevenly and frequently in a piecemeal way, due to a combination of the overemphasis on The History of Sexuality, Vol 1 (to the exclusion of most of his other major works), and the lack of availability of English translations of most of his writings until the early twenty-first century. This course seeks to correct that trend and to re-introduce Foucault’s works to a generation of graduate students who, on the whole, do not have extensive experience with his oeuvre. In this course, we read almost all of Foucault’s published writings that have been translated into English (which is almost all of them, at this point). We read all of the monographs, and all of the Collège de France lectures, in chronological order. This lightens the reading load; we read a book per week, but the lectures are shorter and generally less dense than the monographs. [The benefit of a single author course is that the more time one spends reading Foucault’s work, the easier reading his work becomes.] We read as many of the essays he published in popular and more widely-circulated media as we can. The goal of the course is to give students both breadth and depth in their understanding of Foucault and his works, and to be able to situate his thinking in relation to the intellectual, social, and political histories of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Alongside Foucault himself, we read Foucault’s mentors, interlocutors, and inheritors (Heidegger, Marx, Blanchot, Canguilhem, Derrida, Barthes, Althusser, Bersani, Hartman, Angela Davis, etc); his critics (Mbembe, Weheliye, Butler, Said, etc.), and scholarship that situates his thought alongside contemporary social movements, including student, Black liberation, prison abolitionist, and anti-psychiatry movements. Previously ENGL 907."

"AMST 720 - Variety and Standardization": {
	Professor: Jamil Drake
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Variety and standardization number among Western modernity’s favorite binaries, fully entangled with another sibling set of "dualities": religion and secularization. In the United States, the process of "nationing" citizens (to use Tony Bennett’s term) has taken the shape and motto of a linear movement from variety to standardization: e pluribus unum, out of many one. Perhaps not surprisingly, given the US Constitution’s stated commitment to free exercise and nonestablishment, religion invites us to explore the relationship and tension between variety and standardization in American sociopolitical life. On the one hand, religion is a site that not only accommodates but also generates a variety of diverse identities, communities, ideals, epistemes, and practices. On the other hand, religion is a site that enforces standardization and encourages adherence and conformity to authorized ideals, knowledges, behaviors, and institutions. Under pressure of these "opposing" rubrics, variety and standardization are co-constitutive in configuring and managing racial, class, gender/sexual, and national as well as religious differences. This graduate seminar explores religion within the interstices of variety and standardization and at their intersections. Guest experts in the field(s) have been invited to present their work. Given the professors’ geography of expertise, the in-class course content most closely examines variety and standardization in the context of the United States. Other geographical/chronological interest and expertise is welcome and encouraged in student projects, course readings, and class discussion."

	Professor: Kathryn Dudley
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This research seminar examines the anthropological project in the context of the Anthropocene and its intertwined histories of agriculture, empire, slavery, and capitalism. Drawing on transdisciplinary readings that open up multiple ways to conceptualize anthropology’s evolving relationship to our planetary predicament, students develop critical approaches to ecological and governmental problematics produced, as Agamben suggests, by anthropological machines that produce the human and nonhuman within perpetually updated spaces of exception. Throughout we pay close attention to ethnographic analytics and writing practices that trouble such binaries in favor of affective or relational modes of knowing and being. In-class workshops offer opportunities to share term papers in progress."
}
"AMST 798 - Methods in Gender and Sexuality Studies": {
	Professor: Eda Pepi
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This seminar explores the dynamics of power and knowledge, the ethics of representation and accountability, and the nexus between disciplinarity and interdisciplinarity. It is designed for graduate students developing research projects that engage feminist, queer, postcolonial, and critical race methodologies, among others. The course adopts an epistemological approach that centers "encounter" across geopolitical scales and multiple disciplinary fronts in the humanities and social sciences. It posits that research methods, regardless of their origin, can adopt feminist, queer, decolonial/postcolonial, and critical race perspectives and potentially serve counter-disciplinary purposes. Although we cover a broad spectrum of methods—ranging from ethnographic, historiographic/archival, and geographic, to literary, media, and textual analysis, cultural studies, and political theory—our work does not unfold as a practicum. Instead of experimenting with a predefined "toolkit," students critically engage book-length works that demonstrate counter-disciplinary methodologies, reflecting hermeneutically on how method and theory relate in these texts by drawing on Foucault's framework of "the archaeology of knowledge.""

"AMST 966 - Latin American Political Thought II: Neocolonial, Anticolonial, Decolonial: 1930–2020": {
	Professor: Moira Fradinger
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This is the second part of a year-long seminar that started in the fall. The year-long plan introduces students to two centuries of Latin American political thought in the form of social and literary essays produced since the times of independence. It studies how Latin American writers and politicians have theorized the political/cultural heritage of the colony. The second part of the seminar (spring) starts with the 1940s and the rise of populism, engages heavily the sixties, seventies, and eighties and ends with writings on current indigenous movements across the region but especially in the Amazon. During the fall we engage in the nineteenth-century debates over "American identity" that were foundational to the newly constituted nation-states and the turn of the twentieth-century ideas about colonialism and neocolonialism. The spring explores debates over cultural independence, the movement of "indigenismo," mestizaje, transculturation and heterogeneity, the sixties continuation of "negritude," the reworking of the metaphor of "cannibalism" to account for the cultural politics of the region, concepts such as "internal colonialism" and "motley society," and the polemics over the region’s capitalist modernity and postmodernity (authors include Fanon, Léon Damas, Paulo Freire, Augusto Boal, Theotonio dos Santos, Angel Rama, Retamar, Pino Solanas, Octavio Getino, Aníbal Quijano, Cornejo Polar, Edmundo O’Gorman, Antonio Candido, Darcy Ribeiro, Pablo González Casanova, León-Portilla, R.

"ANTH 600 - Anthropological Imaginations": {
	Professor: Paul Kockelman
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This is the second course of a yearlong sequence for doctoral students in Anthropology and combined programs. The seminar explores anthropological imaginations as modes of experience, perception, and writing. Anthropology as a discipline has transformed from the frontline of colonial projects to critical reflections on power dynamics that produce and reproduce systems of oppression, injustice, and violence. Yet knowing and representing are never external to these power dynamics, and there is simply a vast unknowability of human and non-human experiences. How do we as anthropologists give meanings to the world out there that is so intertwined and complex beneath what we see and hear? How do we see what seems invisible and how to listen to silence? How do we account for our own implication in the encounters through which we experience and learn, and reflect upon? How do we weave stories through writing? While there are no right or wrong answers to these questions, in this seminar we explore how different imaginaries open up new possibilities as we embark on our ethnographic research."

	Professor: Owen Miller
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course is an introduction to modern nanophotonic theory and design. We introduce a broad range of mathematical and computational tools with which one can analyze, understand, and design for a diverse range of nanophotonic phenomena. The course is meant to be in the orthogonal complement of traditional courses working through Jackson’s Classical Electrodynamics—we (mostly) avoid specialized high-symmetry cases in which Maxwell’s equations can be solved exactly. Instead, our emphasis is on general mode, quasinormal-mode, and scattering-matrix descriptions, as well as surface- and volume-integral formulations that distill the essential physics of complex systems. The unique properties and trade-offs for a variety of computational methods, including finite-element, finite-difference, integral-equation, and modal-expansion (e.g., RCWA) approaches, comprise a significant portion of the latter half of the term. The robust open-source computational tools Meep, S4, and NLopt are introduced early on, to be learned and utilized throughout the term."

"ARCH 1213 - Books and Architecture": {
	Professor: Luke Bulman
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "For architects, the book has been a necessary (if not essential) tool for clarifying, extending, and promoting their ideas and projects. This seminar examines the phenomenon of the book in architecture as both an array of organizational techniques (what it is) and as a mediator (what it does). Arguably, outside of the artifice and material fact of the building itself, the book has been the preferred mode of discourse that architects have chosen to express their intellectual project. This seminar is part lecture, part workshop where the experience of making a series of books helps to inform the development of ideas about the projective capacity of the book. Through case studies, this seminar examines the relationship book production has with a selection of contemporary and historical practices, including each project’s physical and conceptual composition as well as how each project acts as an agent of the architect within a larger world of communication. The second part of the seminar asks students to apply ideas in a series of three book projects that emphasize the book as an instrument of architectural thinking. Most projects are individual efforts, but work in pairs or groups is also explored. Limited enrollment."

The chair is both a model for understanding architecture and a laboratory for the concise expression of idea, material, fabrication, and form. As individual as its authors, the chair provides a medium that is a controllable minimum structure, ripe for material and conceptual experiments. In this seminar, students develop their design and fabrication skills through exploration of the conceptual, aesthetic, and structural issues involved in the design and construction of a full-scale prototype chair.

"ARCH 1260 - Beauty, Wonder & Awe": {
	Professor: Mark Gage
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This seminar explores the role of beauty, wonder, and awe in the design and experience of our world. For most of the 20th century, these subjects were either entirely ignored in academia, or worse, cast exclusively as nefarious mechanisms of control used only by those in power. And yet who among us has not been uplifted by a scene in a film, a piece of music, an object, a work of art or architecture—or perhaps even something as unassuming as a beautifully cascading pile of laundry? This course will work under the assumption that such positive human experiences are needed more now than ever in a world increasingly defined by pessimism, criticism, and division. As such we will work under the assumption that beauty, wonder, and awe exist, and that they are worthy of a contemporary re-assessment, especially in the context of creative practices that are interested in producing a more equitable, beautiful, and just human future. Through both philosophical and popular readings, the study of physical objects, and engaged discussion and lively debate, we will examine beauty, awe, and wonder from all possible angles- what they mean today, their history, why they are desired, how they might be produced, the motivations of those that promote them, and how they are being reconsidered not as the nefarious enemies of function or equality, but rather essential and ethically significant aspects of human experience. In order to address these subjects beyond an abstract academic setting, we will have visitors from various creative industries come to class to discuss these subjects relative to their own work and disciplines- including Jessica Diehl, the former creative director of Vanity Fair magazine, and Michael Young, a practicing architect deeply engaged with the subjects of aesthetics and representation. Students in the course will also (pending confirmation) visit New York City to explore and discuss these subjects at multiple scales, live and in person with the instructor, by viewing everything from architectural facades and urban monuments to medieval armor and Faberge eggs. This course will resist the inherited lore of academia that casts beauty, wonder, and awe only elitist or oppressive, in favor of asking how they can be better understood and incorporated into the design of a more humane world. In doing so we will explore the work of contemporary thinkers who offer nourishment to this endeavor including but not limited to Elaine Scarry, Jane Bennett, Timothy Morton, bell hooks, Nick Zangwill, Dacher Keltner, Georgio Agamben, Susan Magsamen, and others, including recent writings on aesthetics by the course instructor.

	Professor: Adam Hopfner
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "(Required of first-year M.Arch. I students.) This course explores the conception and construction of dwelling space in the city. Through a term-long process of collaborative research, analysis, design, and technical documentation, student teams examine the specific relationship of the human body to its environment, the elemental concerns of inhabitation, and the physical, spatial, and technical formation of building. A series of iterative analytical exercises, conducted at a range of scales using various analytical tools and design media, address the building site, its enclosure, apertures, interior surfaces, and its fixtures and fittings, and their roles in mediating our experience of private and social space, of weather, and of climate. This collaborative process begins at the start of the term with the formation of design teams and the introduction of our Building Project partners: our clients at Columbus House of New Haven, a New Haven-based shelter and permanent supportive housing provider for the homeless, and the New Haven city officials who administer the city’s zoning, building, and life-safety laws and regulations under the auspices of New Haven’s Livable City Initiative. Over the course of the term and in conjunction with a series of lectures, field trips, and workshops, each student team develops and documents a distinct and technically detailed design proposal for a two-family house, one of which is selected at the end of the term. This work sets the stage for the second phase of the course and the subsequent work of the summer: the construction of the Jim Vlock Building Project house in New Haven’s Hill neighborhood."

"ARCH 2226 - Design Computation": {
	Professor: Michael Szivos
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "The capabilities and limitations of architects’ tools influence directly the spaces architects design. Computational machines, tools once considered only more efficient versions of paper-based media, have a demonstrated potential beyond mere imitation. This potential is revealed through design computation, the creative application of the processes and reasoning underlying all digital technology, from email to artificial intelligence. Just as geometry is fundamental to drawing, computation affords a fundamental understanding of how data works, which is essential to advance the development of BIM, performative design, and other emerging methodologies. This seminar introduces design computation as a means to enable architects to operate exempt from limitations of generalized commercial software; to devise problem-specific tools, techniques, and workflows; to control the growing complexities of contemporary architectural design; and to explore forms generated only by computation itself. Topics include data manipulation and translation, algorithms, information visualization, computational geometry, human-computer interaction, custom tooling, generative form-finding, emergent behavior, simulation, and system modeling. Using Processing, students develop computational toolsets and models through short, directed assignments ultimately comprising a unified, term-long project. Limited enrollment."

"ARCH 2240 - The Architect As: Recasting the Role of the Architect in the Development Lifecycle": {
	Professor: Antonia Devine
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "An introduction to the real estate development lifecycle through the lens of the Architect. The course follows the typical chronology of a multi-family residential project starting from a developer's initial interest in a site, to a resident inhabiting the completed building; in between, it addresses feasibility, acquisitions, zoning, financing, design, construction, marketing and branding, and operations. We will employ this linear framework first to understand the underlying components of each phase, and second to evaluate: what is the role of the Architect - past versus present, real versus perceived? Where the Architect’s role has been eroded or altered over time, how can they rebuild it - leveraging their multifaceted skillset or learning new modes of analysis - to maximize agency and impact? Finally, we will ask broader questions that cut across the development lifecycle: what does an enhanced Architect mean for the other players along the value chain? What does it mean for the ability of the Architect to impact development strategy, or to frame development as a series of design challenges? How does the dynamic between form and finance, design and development change? And, what does the rebuilt Architect mean for the final product – the realized building – and the built environment? The seminar examines traditional and hybrid design practices through readings, assignments, and guest lectures. As a final project, students submit a design-driven development proposal for a site in New Haven, employing the disruptive practices learned over the semester."

This course seeks to question modern architecture and historiography through the lenses of both colonialism and decoloniality. Colonialism and the power structures that sustained it have deeply affected architecture across the globe and left a pervasive mark on the histories of architecture in use to this day. At the same time, forceful and resilient counter-cultures emerged throughout colonized, and later postcolonial, nations which engendered extraordinary architecture and critically aware historiographies that continually challenge the universalist pretensions of western modernity. Our agenda is a historiography that does not speak from the center alone but from the "margins" as well---a diverse, inclusive account that rejects hegemonic narratives and practices. Deconstructing binaries, it engages in self-reflexive critique, works to pluralize authorship, and brings analytical rigor to bear on its main task: to uncover the persistence of Euro-centered modes in the production of architectural knowledge even in the supposedly postcolonial present; and to suggest other interpretive models."

It aims to contextualize it within the broader architectural explorations occurring in Mexico at the time and in reaction and relation to architectural developments in the US and Europe. The intention is to closely study the work's theoretical and historical underpinnings, their architectural character and formal innovations, and the context of their production. The investigations will result in written documents, models, drawings, etc. that will form part of an exhibition of this work at the Barragán Gallery at the Vitra Design Museum in Germany. The class, as a result, will be in contact with the Barragán Foundation and archive and be partially responsible for helping organize the exhibition layout and curate the material to be presented."

Recognizing that the unusually vivid architectural images that have impressed themselves upon the public imagination of America over the past few months are only the most recent evidence in a longer list of charges, the course examines accusations of Eurocentrism and elitism, of obsolescence, irrelevance, and historical naivete, and associations with totalitarianism and whiteness, along with questions of language, tectonics, and sustainability—aiming to introduce a range of new voices into a conversation that is, today, more critical than ever."
}
"ARCH 3329 - Writing and Criticism: Restaging Criticism": {
	Professor: Christopher Hawthorne
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This course examines the relationship between practice and publication in architecture. Its foundation is a survey of architecture criticism over the last century. It also considers how a select number of architects have written about their own work and that of other practitioners; the focus in this section is on those architects who use writing not for its descriptive or promotional value but as a critic or historian might, which is to say as a means of sharpening or expanding their own architecture or of reframing or even unsettling their place in the profession or larger culture. Class discussions focus to a large degree on the intersection of these two tracks: the process by which the architect moves from subject to author and back again, and what is gained (and perhaps sometimes lost) by that traffic."
}
"ARCH 3332 - Laboring for Architecture": {
	Professor: Jordan Carver
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "Architecture—as a profession and pedagogy—has always had a complicated relationship to labor. As a practice, architecture requires inputs, time, and effort from many people with many different types of knowledge. From the design and development of architectural drawings in office settings, to the construction of buildings on site, to the production of architectural materials across the world, building projects are accumulations of different forms of labor, manufacturing capacities, and expertise. This seminar analyzes and investigates the labor(s) required to create architecture, from design through construction. We locate the laboring bodies that produce building projects and the knowledge that surrounds them. And we interrogate how the profession understands its past, present, and possible future relations to labor. The first half of the semester considers architecture’s shift from a building practice to a knowledge practice. We frame the architect as a worker and closely analyze the types of worker inequality found within the office and profession. The second half of the semester focuses on the long history of forced and enslaved labor on construction sites and the persistence of it in the material supply chain."

"ARCH 4297 - Historic Preservation in the 21st Century": {
	Professor: Norma Barbacci
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This seminar explores the evolution of historic preservation from a narrow focus on monumental properties to its broader, more complex, and more inclusive current purview. The course begins by learning about the history of the field of preservation through the understanding of its theoretical roots, definitions, professional practice, and the basics of material conservation. This introduction serves as a preamble to the second part of the course which focuses on the expanding role and potential future of historic preservation as it aligns its objectives with the principles of sustainability, social inclusion, and decolonization. At the end of this seminar, the students should have a working understanding of the theory and practice of historic preservation, the wide array of its concerns and sub-specialties, and its potential as an agent for sustainable development and social inclusion; the basic concepts of material conservation and documentation of existing conditions; and the challenges and opportunities presented by a preservation project in an underserved community."

	Description: "This course considers approaches to teaching and learning from the perspective of artists. While many artists teach—whether in the museum, art school, or elsewhere—pedagogical practice is seldom considered an important facet of their own training as artists. Throughout the semester we explore a diverse range of theories, frameworks, and models to do with the learning and teaching of art. This includes case studies on artists and collectives who have developed distinctive perspectives on pedagogy and experimented with the relationship between their teaching and artistic practices. We consult artists’ writings, archival material, and works of art, as well as texts from the fields of philosophy, art theory and history, and pedagogy. While not strictly an instructional class on how to teach, some exercises designed to support the development of practical skills (such as designing workshops, writing syllabi, and planning classes) are incorporated throughout the semester."

The answers are many: transcripts, letters, sketches, photographs, and other records of past events. Media such as these support the production of a specific type of knowledge called archival research. This seminar explores how this mode of knowing emerged and why it acquired the discursive authority it holds today. Although primarily intended for historians of architecture, art, and urbanism, this course is interdisciplinary by design. Readings approach the history of archives from multiple perspectives: their evolution as an architectural space; their role in shaping research practices and conventions of disciplinary knowledge; and their relation to bureaucracy, governance, colonialism, and other systems of modern state formation. Moreover, engaging perspectives from critical theory, this course considers how "archival space" constructs its boundaries by silencing voices and excluding certain ways of knowing. Visits to local and regional archives will supplement our group discussions. Students will consequently gain the perspectives and tools needed for future research endeavors, from the preparation of a doctoral dissertation to creative studio practice."

"ART 514 - Colorspace": {
	Professor: Kern Samuel
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "How can we "redesign a rainbow," as Paul Thek suggests in his 1978 "Teaching Notes for the Fourth Dimension"? The psychophysical dimensions of color have been continually debated, reinvented, structured, codified, mystified, and systematized. The term "color space" refers to a range of color mapped by a system, such as RGB or CMYK. But long before these models were used to describe color on screen or paper, artists were utilizing systems to organize color in their work. Hue, value, saturation, and surface are all relative components artists use to structure color in specific ways. In this course we explore the space of color, from its visual and psychological qualities to its relationship to language and culture. Through assignments and critiques, students experiment with different approaches to using color in their own work. Readings and presentations examine principles of color interaction, as well as color’s expressive and symbolic potential. Open to all M.F.A. students."

"ART 598 - Alternative Cloth Processes": {
	Professor: Sarah Zapata
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "A hands-on, technique-based course offered within a dedicated shared studio space, Alternative Cloth Processes explores fiber-related praxis through a series of investigations into stitching, basketry, needlecraft, and knots, as well as the further study of more complicated weave structures and pattern weaving. Instruction is intended to serve individual studio practice, but weekly meetings in the classroom space provide an opportunity to develop and share technical skills as a group in relationship to specific prompts. Readings and presentations contextualize our material explorations within contemporary art practice, unpacking historical hierarchies of "fine art" vs. "craft" and attending to the diverse social histories that underlie our engagement with textiles. The course includes some site visits, including artists' studios and textile production facilities."

"ART 604 - The Word is My Fourth Dimension": {
	Professor: Kameelah Rasheed
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "The course title comes from the 2012 English translation of Clarice Lispector’s Água Viva (1973). This course invites us to make work that engages with text and writing and explore the artists who push us to consider new relationships to language. Beyond the page, we explore text practices across various substrates and environments: the browser, the wall, the body, the sky, and the land. We consider legibility, translation, duration, embodiment, quantum physics, and pleasure in generating and studying text-based practices. Classes include opportunities for play, discussions, short lectures, and making. Assignments in this class include one presentation, one summative text-based work, one short essay, and active class participation. In the background of the course, we slowly read Lispector’s Água Viva as a haunt in our study of those who attempt to wrangle language."

"ART 623 - Hostile Environments": {
	Professor: Joseph Buckley
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "What is a hostile environment? How have environments designed to humiliate, terrorize, and destroy differed in physical, institutional, and psychic contexts? What does it mean for artists today to contend with such conditions—real and imagined? What does it mean to make work upon the eve of roaring, incoming tragedy—if said tragedy has not already unevenly arrived? Through readings and discussion in this seminar class, we consider and unpack unpopular and repulsive works and ideas. Together, we work through politics, history, science fiction, and horror, in order to question: How it is that we can continue to exist in these incoming (or already present) hostile environments, as people and as artists? Is it appropriate to consider changing ourselves, evolving and warping, in order to survive? And, how do we understand those who’ve contributed to, created, instigated, and produced their own hostile environments?"

}
"ART 743 - Letterform Design": {
	Professor: Nina Stoessinger
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "Designing typefaces means building systems of recombinable letterforms. It is therefore distinct from other letter-making disciplines in that it necessarily calls for a systematic approach. Besides optical and aesthetic issues presented by individual letters, the course focuses on building a consistent typeface design by way of a structured and systematic process. Students create their own digital typefaces, working on individual projects chosen in consultation with the main instructor. The project definition necessarily includes aesthetic as well as functional goals; with the problems of type design so deeply interconnected, a clear project definition is needed to establish relevant criteria for testing and evaluating the work. Projects are usually based on one or more historical references, which are understood as guideposts but not constraints. The course is taught with RoboFont, a leading font editor program for Macintosh OS X that allows designers to construct letterforms on screen and turn them into usable fonts. Students are introduced to the software while learning the principles of designing and spacing type. Fully fledged type designers are not made in one term; the object is to "demystify" the subject and teach users of type an increased appreciation and deeper understanding of it."
}
"ART 754 - Code and Interfaces": {
	Professor: Alvin Ashiatey
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This course invites an in-depth examination of the digital tools that are integral to the graphic design practice. It is common for designers to default to industry-standard software, which can inadvertently narrow creative exploration. Our goal is to go beyond the usual limits by finding new ways to use current technologies, linking different tools together, and maybe even creating our own custom digital tools. We examine the technologies we currently use and search for new, maybe even unconventional, methodologies for creation and knowledge production. The course is structured around a series of lectures, group discussions, and hands-on workshops and culminates in a substantive project. This course does not require a background in software development, merely a willingness to engage with new media in novel and inventive ways. The workshops in this course cover a range of tools and techniques, including p5.js, Processing, Drawbot, InDesign Scripting, Web Scraping, OpenCV, and natural language processing. These sessions are designed to provide hands-on experience and enhance students' digital toolkit."

"ART 812 - The Assignment: Photography, Context, and Response from Classrooms to Commissions": {
	Professor: John Pilson
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "Photographers continue to find themselves navigating the multiplicity of "contexts" their medium inhabits. This course examines various historical and contemporary examples of photographic "call and response" wherein artists find their way within both the obstacles and the opportunities presented to them by clients, curators, and editors, and (as students and teachers) within various pedagogical models. Through lectures, individual case studies, and student presentations we look to examples of authorship, artistic integrity, self-reflectivity, the exceeding of expectations, and convention-defying subversions that might just as readily be deployed within the context of a fashion spread as a museum, biennale, or government commission for an original work."

}
"ART 937 - Artist’s Choice": {
	Professor: Sam Contis
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This course takes its name from the long-running exhibition series at MoMA. For the first iteration of the series, in 1989, the artist Scott Burton was "invited to select, juxtapose, and comment on" works in the permanent collection. The show he created, Burton on Brancusi, offered a radical reframing of a single artist’s work from a contemporary perspective, while at the same time giving insights into Burton’s own practice. Recent iterations have included shows by Amy Sillman, Yto Barrada, and Grace Wales Bonner. Taking this series as our starting point, our theme is the fundamental role that artists have played as curators of other artists’ works. What happens when an artist takes on the role of curator? What sort of freedoms might an artist enjoy in this role? How might their choices differ from those of other curators or of art historians? Through readings, class discussions, and museum and special collection visits, we consider various ways in which exhibition-making is a creative act, looking at a wide range of examples where artists have used their unique perspectives to rethink conventional strategies of presentation. The aim is in part to encourage students to think more expansively about presentation and exhibition choices in relation to their own work."
}
"ART 975 - Interdepartmental Group Critique": {
	Professor: A.L. Steiner
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "The four departments in the School of Art have critique opportunities for members of their individual areas. In the past faculty members have offered regular extra-curricular interdepartmental critiques on Sunday nights and Wednesday mornings. This course furthers that tradition by critiquing and discussing work by students from each department by those who are not familiar with the concerns, language, or material methods of a medium-specific field. By critique and analysis of each participant’s work, we attempt to break down the boundaries of medium and area. The course is designed for those who are interested in pushing medium orthodoxy aside to clear a space where and the development of language and renewed understandings are possible. Enrolled students exchange studio/desk visits with their classmates outside of class time as well as write about each other’s work. Each week, one shorter critique is offered by lottery to an M.F.A. student at the School of Art not enrolled in the class. This course is co-taught by multiple faculty and visiting critics, with one lead faculty member. Enrollment is limited. Permission of the instructor required."

"BIS 628 - Longitudinal and Multilevel Data Analysis": {
	Professor: Veronika Shabanova
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This course covers methods for analyzing longitudinal data in which repeated measures have been obtained for subjects over time and for analyzing multilevel data, which can be either hierarchically or nonhierarchically structured, e.g., nested, crossed, and/or clustered. The course teaches the common analytic techniques that can be used to analyze both longitudinal data and multilevel data with both continuous and discrete responses. One defining feature of the data is the correlation among responses over time within the same subject in longitudinal data and/or among different observations within a same cluster in multilevel data, which has to be accommodated in order to make valid inference about the responses. Emphasis is on mixed-effects models and generalized estimating equations (GEE). Rationales on whether population-average research or subject-/cluster-specific inference research may be more appropriate for various study designs and data types are discussed and illustrated. More advanced topics including mixture models, missing data methods, and causal inference are discussed if time allows. Analysis in presence of missing data is incorporated throughout the lectures and the labs. Emphasis is placed on applying the methods, understanding underlying assumptions, and interpreting results for analyzing real data using standard statistical software. Additional material on computational aspects and theoretic aspects of mixed models. R and SAS software is used for analysis of data."
}
"BIS 630 - Applied Survival Analysis": {
	Professor: Yuan Huang
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "Survival analysis is a critical field in statistics for analyzing time-to-event (survival) data which are commonly encountered in clinical and medical research. Survival data typically involve various forms of censoring and truncation, necessitating specialized developments in analytical approaches.  This practical course covers fundamental concepts, descriptive analysis, testing procedures, and modeling techniques, including nonparametric, parametric, and semi-parametric approaches.

It also incorporates case studies, journal readings, discussions, and encourages active student engagement."
}
"BIS 631 - Advanced Topics in Causal Inference Methods": {
	Professor: Laura Forastiere
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "The evaluation of a public policy program designed to improve the health and well-being of a population requires the use of statistical methods for the estimation of its effects and the knowledge of causal inference tools to attribute the estimated effects to our intervention of interest. When studies are not well designed, several complications may arise. This course covers advanced topics of causal inference in complex settings, known as "irregular designs," where the common assumptions required for the estimation of causal effects do not hold. Irregular designs include randomized experiments affected by non-compliance, censoring or missing outcomes, and observational studies with unmeasured confounders. We also learn how to deal with other irregular designs, including panel studies with time-invariant unmeasured confounders and regression discontinuity designs where the treatment is assigned based on a cut-off rule on test scores or poverty indexes and hence is affected by the lack of overlap. The second part of the course focuses on ways to go beyond the treatment effect and investigate all the mechanisms that come into play when the intervention is implemented: causal pathways, spillover effects, and heterogeneity. A better understanding of these mechanisms can help us improve the design of our intervention. We first learn statistical methods to disentangle causal pathways through which the intervention has an effect. We then relax the common assumption of independence between units and allow the treatment of one unit to affect the outcome of other units. We present cutting-edge statistical methods to estimate spillover or peer-influence effects in clusters of units or in social networks. The last part of the course deals with identification of heterogeneous treatment effects using standard and machine-learning approaches. Identifying subgroups of individuals for whom the effect is more beneficial can help us design optimal and cost-effective treatment strategies where the treatment is assigned to specific individuals. The course is complemented with interesting examples from the social and health sciences."

	Credits: 1
	Description: "The purpose of the Mentored Clinical Experience (MCE), an MRSP-specific course, is to permit students to gain a deep understanding of and appreciation for the interface between basic biomedical research and its application to clinical practice. The MCE is intended to integrate basic and translational research with direct exposure to clinical medicine and patients afflicted with the diseases or conditions under discussion. The course provides a foundation and a critically important forum for class discussion because each module stimulates students to explore a disease process in depth over four ninety-minute sessions led by expert clinician-scientists. The structure incorporates four perspectives to introduce the students to a particular disease or condition and then encourages them to probe areas that are not understood or fully resolved so they can appreciate the value and challenge inherent in using basic science to enhance clinical medicine. Students are provided biomedical resource material for background to the sessions as well as articles or other publicly available information that offers insight to the perspective from the non-scientific world. During this course students meet with patients who have experienced the disease and/or visit and explore facilities associated with diagnosis and treatment of the disease process. Students are expected to prepare for sessions, to participate actively, and to be scrupulously respectful of patients and patient facilities. Prior to one of the sessions, students receive guidance as to what they will observe and how to approach the experience; and at the end of the session, the students discuss their thoughts and impressions. All students receive HIPAA training and appropriate training in infection control and decorum relating to patient contact prior to the course."

"CHEM 594 - Resonant and Non-Resonant Interaction of Light with Matter": {
	Professor: Mark Johnson
	Credits: 0.5
	Description: "This course considers the interaction of light with individual molecules and collections of molecules in solutions and solids from the perspective of a classical radiation field interacting with the energy levels that arise from quantized motions. We begin with the generation of light by accelerated charges as described by Maxwell’s equations for the electric and magnetic fields. We then consider the polarization states of light, how the oscillating electric field drives the motions of electrons, and how this results in scattering when off-resonant and then evolves into shifts in level populations as the frequency approaches that of the eigenenergies between levels. Classical analogies to quantum mechanical behavior are stressed in the context of the damped-driven electron in a harmonic potential (the so-called Drude model). The kinetics of absorption and emission are discussed in the context of the Einstein treatment that leads to light amplification and laser action. Finally, we develop the "selection rules" that describe what transitions can occur depending on the light polarization and the character of the electronic and nuclear motions."

Various religious traditions are represented, including ancient Near Eastern and Greek polytheism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, and early and medieval Christianity. We look at both the distinctive features of image use in these cultures and the links among them, including the connection of sacred images to the dead, the numinous presence of relics, the importance of concealment and revelation, the instrumental power of votive objects, the role of images in sacrificial rites, and problems of idolatry and iconoclasm."
}
"CLSS 876 - The Aethiopica of Heliodorus: Late Antique Fiction in Context": {
	Professor: Benedek Kruchio
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Heliodorus (late fourth century CE) is antiquity's most virtuosic and quirky storyteller. In addition to its narratological virtuosity, the Aethiopica is fascinating as a testament to the cultural complexities of its time: Telling the adventures of an Ethiopian princess and her Greek lover, Heliodorus’s erotic novel is a story about race, concealed and unstable identities, sexual and religious purity. This seminar tackles Heliodorus with a combined focus on text and context. We, on the one hand, explore his narrative aesthetics (with the occasional help of various literary theories, from ancient to cutting-edge). On the other hand, we ask ourselves how the different reading communities of late antiquity might have approached this fascinating text: the rhetorically educated elite, Neoplatonist philosophers, and Christians. This course is of interest for those excited about any of the following: the history of fiction; literary theory; the cultural history of late antiquity; the ancient history of religion, philosophy, and sexuality; the relationship between late pagans and early Christians; and, finally, great stories."

"CPLT 510 - The Mortality of the Soul: From Aristotle to Bernard Williams": {
	Professor: No professor
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course explores fundamental philosophical questions of the relation between matter and form, life and spirit, necessity and freedom, by proceeding from Aristotle’s analysis of the soul in De Anima and his notion of practical agency in the Nicomachean Ethics. We study Aristotle in conjunction with seminal works by contemporary neo-Aristotelian philosophers (Korsgaard, Nussbaum, Brague, and McDowell). We in turn pursue the implications of Aristotle’s notion of life by engaging with contemporary philosophical discussions of death that take their point of departure in Epicurus (Nagel, Williams, Scheffler). We conclude by analyzing Heidegger’s notion of constitutive mortality, in order to make explicit what is implicit in the form of the soul in Aristotle."
}
"CPLT 551 - World Literature in Theory and Practice": {
	Professor: Samuel Hodgkin
	Credits: 1
	Description: ""World literature studies" has emerged over the past generation at institutions across the U.S. as a pedagogical alternative to comparative literature, although whether it constitutes a real conceptual challenge to the discipline or a mere rebranding remains to be seen. In scholarship, the phrase "world literature" originally stood for the effort to make Western comparative literature less Eurocentric, but it is used by its advocates and critics to refer to a bewildering array of incompatible methods and objects of study, from world systems theory to translation and reception studies and the stakes of the concept of a world as such. This seminar prepares participants to enter an academic and publishing sphere in which the idea of world literature is everywhere, but its meaning is an object of general contestation. Theorists discussed include Apter, Brouillette, Casanova, Cheah, Damrosch, Even-Zohar, Goethe, Gorky, Herder, Mahler, Moretti, Orsini, Pollock, Spivak, and the Warwick Research Collective. Literary case studies include Ismailov, Kadare, Pavic, and a range of literary anthologies from the past two centuries. Over the course of the semester, students work together to trace their chosen writers and literary movements through a variety of reception and translation contexts."

"CPLT 567 - Columbus to Google: A Critical History of the Archive": {
	Professor: Alexander Gil Fuentes
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Modern libraries and archives cannot be understood without a steady reference to the history of European conquest and colonial expansion. In the twenty-first century, we are as likely to mourn its evident gaps and silences as to rejoice in its feats of accumulation. Scholars today train to read between the lines, against the grain, to mind the gaps, and even to critically fabulate to be able to reconstruct the lived world and knowledge lost in the wake of European genocide and erasure. Not far from his father’s desire to see and own all, Ferdinand Columbus imagined and went out of his way to build a universal library of all that was known and could be known. We begin our course here, at the encounter, when cosmography and bibliography seem to collapse into each other, driven by the Euro-Christian will to conquer. We end in the present when companies like Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, Clarivate, and other specific actors have gained enormous power through their ability to aggregate, index, and manipulate massive corpora; now, when the cultural and historical record of humanity has become a hybrid construct, part analog, part digital; but also when so-called generative AI begins to make its hallucinatory contributions to that very record. Instead of tracing a prefabricated history of libraries and archives, we revisit key episodes, tropes, ideas, and practices from the past 500 years to investigate how the de facto archive of humanity came to be the way it is today. We also encourage and hopefully inspire each other to imagine new ways of understanding how the human record is not only a simple byproduct of human activity, but often produces and frames that very activity, helping us connect our historical and theoretical sketches to contemporary concerns: the Anthropocene, the corporate threat to research and education, persistent inequalities, neo-colonialism, and more."

"CPLT 582 - Chaucer and Translation": {
	Professor: Ardis Butterfield
	Credits: 1
	Description: "An exploration of the works of Geoffrey Chaucer (ca. 1340–1400), brilliant writer and translator. Using modern postcolonial as well as medieval theories of translation, memory, and bilingualism, we investigate how texts in French, Latin, and Italian are transformed, cited, and reinvented in his writings. Some key questions include: What happens to language under the pressure of crosslingual reading practices? What happens to the notion of translation in a multilingual culture? How are ideas of literary history affected by understanding Chaucer’s English in relation to the other more prestigious language worlds in which his poetry was enmeshed? Texts include material in French, Middle English, Latin, and Italian. Proficiency in any one or more of these languages is welcome, but every effort is made to use texts available in modern English translation, so as to include as wide a participation as possible in the course. Formerly ENGL 545."

We'll examine how a new language of art and nature focused on the experience of the beholder and track evolving categories of the sublime, beautiful, and picturesque in key texts of philosophy and literature. We'll connect ideas of aesthetic judgment and autonomy to central institutions and ideologies of the modern era, including the public sphere, secularism, the private subject, racial capitalism, and the market. Readings begin with empirical philosophies of perception and early accounts of the aesthetic in Locke, Addison, Hutcheson, Pope, Hume, and Burke and continue through the watershed moment of Wordsworth, Coleridge, Kant, and Schiller. The seminar ends with a consideration of aesthetic theory in the long contemporary period of Adorno, Scarry, Rancière, and Ngai. Previously ENGL 768."

"CPLT 667 - Karl Marx’s Capital Volume II, The Circulation System": {
	Professor: Paul North
	Credits: 1
	Description: "We spend the semester carefully studying Volume II of Marx’s Capital, along with relevant drafts, letters, and selected criticism. Volume II analyzes the circulation system, what Marx called in a letter to Engels "the social intertwining of different capitals." Stepping beyond the scene of production in Volume I, where we learned how surplus value is made out of stolen labor, now we learn how the pressures to send out this surplus value onto a market and return it in transformed form to the capitalist shape space and time, impel increases in velocity and slowdowns, in the race to reproduce the system each year and to expand it, so as to accumulate more. In short, circulation makes the world go round. We ask: how is production of value connected to the realization of value in the marketplace? What are the constraints on capitalists that drive the extraction of surplus value? What do capitalists actually have do in the capital system? Along the way, we find out how especially "expanded reproduction" has such detrimental effects on populations, not to mention on the earth."

	Professor: Bo kyung Im
	Credits: 1
	Description: "While a narrative of technologically driven advancement dominates the digital age, an accompanying cultural subcurrent of "newtro"—of throwbacks, remembrance, and nostalgic repurposing of bygone materials—marks neoliberal time in contemporary South Korea. This course engages with the OSTs (Original Soundtracks) of two K-dramas—Reply 1988 (tvN, 2015) and Reply 1997 (tvN, 2012). We critically examine their featured love songs’ entanglements with modern Korean temporality. In what ways do vocal, instrumental, and environmental timbres invoke nostalgia and historical memory? What global infrastructures form the conditions of possibility for the production and circulation of Korean love songs? How do love songs generate and orient desire? Can nostalgic gestures engender alternative relationships between present, past, and future? And if so, what possibilities and pitfalls emerge? The first and second halves of the course are each centered around a significant juncture in late twentieth-century South Korean history: 1988 and 1997. Reading across fields such as Korean studies, music studies, religious studies, and anthropology, this interdisciplinary graduate seminar interrogates how nostalgic sonic imaginations formulated in K-Dramas might prompt a reconfiguration of modern temporality itself. Juniors and seniors in the college are welcome."

"ECON 703 - Empirical Trade and Development: A Practitioner’s Guide": {
	Professor: Mayara Felix
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Where is the research frontier on trade and development? Which empirical methods are most used at the frontier? How can they be leveraged to strengthen modeling-intensive papers? What is the role of theory and of structural estimation in this subfield? This course begins with a systematic survey of the most influential papers in trade and development in the past twenty years, characterizing them on empirical approach, role of theory, and type of contribution. In the first half of the course, students (a) revisit commonly used empirical methods (e.g., shift-share, difference-in-differences, matching, etc.), understand their strengths and limitations for questions in trade and development and practice implementing them in replication exercises; (b) critique papers in short referee reports and in-class discussions; and (c) apply learned empirical methods and theoretical insights to a novel research proposal. In the second half of the course, students focus on advancing their research proposal. We focus on content and on exposition. Progress entails (a) critiquing each other’s work, offering actionable feedback and reporting progress; (b) rewrites of their proposal (in slides and in prose), with special attention paid to placement in literature and clear communication; and (c) delivering a final presentation of their research. This is a coding-intensive, writing-intensive, critique-driven course. It is best suited for advanced Ph.D. students in either trade or development already working on independent research (e.g.,years 2-4), but all Ph.D. students are welcome. The course is especially valuable to students working on structure-intensive topics (e.g., networks, spatial, urban) who might not otherwise have practical exposure to reduced-form empirics and can learn to leverage those to strengthen their research."

	Description: "What is the relationship between history and temporality? Perhaps a better question might be: what different relationships have there been between histories and temporalities, and how can interrogating those epistemic shifts generate new ways of "doing" history in the present? This interdisciplinary graduate seminar undertakes a critical genealogy of "history" itself, approaching the Enlightenment and the early-mid-twentieth century as two pivotal moments in the conceptual solidification of the relationship between time (singular) and capital-H history. Readings describing and utilizing foundational theories about time, periodization, and historicism, are juxtaposed against critiques and alternative imaginings in post/de-colonial studies, gender and sexuality studies, performance studies, and various traditions outside of (or opposed to) the canon of modernity. The syllabus includes texts by early modern theorists of history, twentieth-century social theorists, and the critical theoretical engagements that assailed and critiqued them."

"EMST 716 - Envisioning Early Modern Architecture": {
	Professor: Morgan Ng
	Credits: 1
	Description: "From the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries, architects in and beyond Europe conceived buildings of newfound scale, artistry, and technical complexity. This seminar explores the varied graphic and plastic media developed to design, promote, and realize these ambitious structures. Building design and practice were transformed in the early modern period by the growing availability of paper and the dissemination of print. At the same time, older representational media such as parchment, rope, tracing floors, and three-dimensional models continued to maintain their importance in the workshop and on the construction site. Topics of investigation in the seminar include the interactions between these older and newer technologies; the impact of painting on new modes of spatial representation; various formats of paper media such as sketchbooks, treatises, cartoons, and single-sheet prints; convergences between model-making, cabinetry, and sculpture; ephemeral architecture made from pasteboard, plaster, and papier-mâché. The seminar  involves elements of experiential, hands-on practice as well as visits to museum collections in and beyond New Haven. To accommodate this, the class is capped at ten students, with priority for Ph.D. students in history of art, early modern studies, and architecture."

"EMST 815 - Temporalities: Early, Modern, Musical, and Otherwise": {
	Professor: Jessica Peritz
	Credits: 1
	Description: "What can music, a temporal medium, tell us about the relationship between history and temporality? Perhaps a better question might be: what can music and its pasts tell us about the different relationships there have been between history and temporality? This graduate seminar interrogates the interplay between time and history by thinking with music, performance, and sound, exploring how embodied and ephemeral experiences generate multiplicitous ways of "doing" history. We undertake a critical genealogy of "history," musical and otherwise, by centering on the long eighteenth century as the period in which temporalities conceptually solidified into capital-H history. At the same time, we consider how alternative configurations of time from before and beyond the European Enlightenment can destabilize the assumptions of "modern" historicism. As we delve into an array of foundational, interdisciplinary theories about time, periodization, and historicism, we simultaneously pry them open by engaging with critiques from musicology, post/de-colonial studies, gender and sexuality studies, performance studies, and more. The ability to read Western musical notation is absolutely not required, nor is musical background of any kind. Students from different departments are warmly welcomed and have opportunities to both engage deeply with questions and scholarship from within their own areas of expertise as well as to practice thinking across disciplines with colleagues from other fields. Students outside the GSAS (including Yale College students) may enroll with permission from the instructor, so long as there is room in the course."

	Professor: No professor
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course provides an in-depth examination of computers and their hardware-based security issues. The operation of the hardware, from transistors to processor microarchitectures, has intimate impact on the security of the whole system. Often, software or algorithms executing on a computer have no control over, or detailed access to, the underlying hardware. Yet, the operation of the hardware and different types of side-effects, such as changing timing, changing power consumption, EM emanations, or different types of crosstalk effects lead to information leakage. To understand the hardware-based security issues, and how to prevent them, the course focuses on classical microprocessors, accelerators such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays, as well as emerging technologies such as Quantum Computers. For the different types of computers, the course teaches students about the various hardware security issues, and students are able to experiment and perform hands-on exercises to demonstrate different types of information leaks. Students also learn about latest research through reading and presenting research papers in class."
}
"ENGL 5168 - Ekphrasis and Art Criticism": {
	Professor: Carol Armstrong
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Ekphrasis in its ancient Greek sense refers to the vivid description of an object, animal, person, place, scene, or event undertaken as an exercise in oral rhetoric. In that original context, the practice of ekphrasis was meant to "paint" a picture in the mind of the listener, and thus pointed to both the imagistic capacities of verbal language, and the integral link between the image and the imagination. In the twentieth century, ekphrasis acquired a narrower meaning: poetry addressed to or modeled on works of visual art. While informed by both of those understandings, this seminar considers ekphrasis both more broadly, in terms of genre, and more narrowly, in relation to a partial history of art criticism as a modern form of writing in the anglophone and European worlds, with a focus on the eighteenth through the twentieth century. It treats the different writerly modes now understood to be embraced by the term ekphrasis: not only poetry, but also the prose poem and the novel, as well as the Salon and art review. It also touches on such issues as the Renaissance inversion of the phrase ut pictura poesis; the competition between the arts of word and image; the presence or absence of illustrations; the modern relations between genres and mediums and the question of mediation; and the address of the different arts to the subjectivity of the reader/spectator. In addition to weekly presentations, a short preliminary paper, and a final research paper, students organize and contribute to a workshop on ekphrasis based on their own ekphrastic exercises, undertaken in the Yale Art Gallery. (Some class time is devoted to those exercises.) This seminar is the second of two (the first is HSAR 667); our hope is that students from both seminars will collaborate on this final event."

Formerly ENGL 807."
}
"ENGL 6873 - Modernity and the Time of Literature": {
	Professor: No professor
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course examines transformations in temporality that occurred in the sciences and arts during the twentieth century. From the arrival of Einsteinian relativity to more contemporary proofs on quantum nonlocality, the question of time in the twentieth century threatened to overturn some of our oldest assumptions about cause and effect, duration, history, presentness, and futurity. These new temporalities were as scientifically and philosophically vexing as they were rife with spiritual and aesthetic possibility—a dynamic reflected in the literary and artistic forms that were central to these transformations. Our reading reflects this deeply cross-cultural and interdisciplinary trajectory, including histories of science and technology (Peter Galison, N. Katherine Hayles, David Kaiser), philosophies of time (Heidegger, Bruno Latour, Bernard Stiegler, McLuhan, Luhmann), critical theories of temporal form (Derrida, Adorno, Jameson, Pamela Lee, Kojin Karatani), a wide array of literary texts (William Burroughs, Thomas Pynchon, Ursula K. Le Guin, Tom McCarthy, and others), as well as important cinematic innovations (Jodorowsky, Godard, Kubrick). What is the "time" of literature? of film? How does art transform or reinforce theories of temporal flow? How do new technologies of composition and circulation alter the temporal effects of a given work? What was the "End of History"? Previously ENGL 973."
}
"ENGL 6887 - Post-1945: Theory and/of the Novel": {
	Professor: John Williams
	Credits: 1
	Description: "What was "theory," and to what extent did it attempt to account for the novel? This course attempts to answer this question with special attention to the rise of critical theory, media studies, and poststructuralism and their impact on novel discourse. We read a variety of now-classic works of post-1945 literary and media theory, as well as a handful of novels that both illuminate and complicate those works. The point is not to cover as much ground as possible so much as to delve into representative works that help clarify what would come to be known as "theory," and how it shaped the formulation of the novel and its relation to competing media. Theoretical readings include texts by Lukacs, Jameson, Derrida, Kristeva, Mark McGurl, Barbara Johnson, Sianne Ngai, and Kate Marshall (among others), and representative novels include authors like Thomas Pynchon, Toni Morrison, Tom McCarthy, Ruth Ozeki, and Philip K. Dick."

"ENV 641 - Market-Based Mechanisms for Water Management": {
	Professor: David Pilz
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This course provides students with both the theory and application of environmental water transactions (EWTs) to water management challenges, such as river restoration, drought-mitigation, and agricultural allocation. The geographic focus is primarily the western United States, as this region, out of necessity, has been very active in implementing EWTs in recent years. Other market-based mechanisms for water management also are explored, such as groundwater mitigation banks, urban stormwater markets, and water quality markets. The course also covers considerations such as environmental justice, tribal access to and use of water, and diversity/equity/inclusion in water management. A final project gives students the opportunity to develop a simple hydrological and water rights model for a fictional watershed to use as the basis for designing a suite of water transactions and market-based water management solutions. This is an online course taught by experienced professionals who value a hands-on approach to learning. In addition, the course features discussion of current events in water, case studies, and guest lectures from practitioners actively using market-based mechanisms for water management."
}
"ENV 646 - Regenerative Agriculture Systems": {
	Professor: Stephen Wood
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "Agriculture systems both depend and have a profound impact on the natural and human environment. There is widespread recognition of the need for agriculture systems to be more regenerative: regenerative food producing systems are ones that contribute to the improvement of the environment and to human wellbeing, not just avoid damages. The aim of this course is to explore what makes food producing systems regenerative. While there is a lot of momentum around the framing of "regenerative agriculture," there is not a lot of detail about what actually makes a system regenerative. The goals of the course are to: provide technical understanding of the science of agricultural systems; develop practical experience applying this science to real world scenarios of strategy development in agriculture; and increase exposure to practitioners at the interface of agriculture and the environment."

"ENV 685 - Engaging Landholders and Communities in Conserving and Restoring Tropical Forest Landscapes": {
	Professor: Eva Garen
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "The design and implementation of sustainable land management strategies in tropical forest landscapes must effectively involve the people and communities who manage and govern these regions. In many cases, however, practitioners design projects that focus on technical solutions only and ignore people altogether, or base their projects upon incorrect assumptions about the people at the heart of their interventions. These trends ultimately lead to project failure and can cause a host of adverse unintended consequences that further exacerbate the problems that practitioners were trying to resolve. This pattern is particularly prevalent with recent pledges by global organizations and national governments to plant trillions of trees around the globe in an effort to address the adverse effects of climate change (The Bonn Challenge and Trillion Trees). While these initiatives are well-intended, they largely ignore the sociocultural and political complexities of the landscapes where the trees would be planted, including whether landholders already plant or protect trees and if they want to increase this practice and how; which species they want to plant or protect and how; and the effects of tree planting on land tenure systems, traditional livelihood strategies, and gender dynamics. Little attention is also given to examining who removed the trees from the landscape and why and whether tree planting is an appropriate solution."

"ENV 725 - Water, Energy, and Food Interconnections in a Changing Climate": {
	Professor: James Saiers
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "Water, energy, and food systems are interconnected. Over-appropriation of freshwater to support irrigated agriculture and to develop non-renewable and renewable energy sources has depleted rivers and aquifers, contributing to growing water scarcity that imperils food and energy security. This problem is exacerbated by climate change, which is lowering precipitation and riverine flows in water-stressed regions, increasing crop-water requirements, and raising energy demands for cooling. This seminar is intended to illuminate the relations between freshwater demand and availability, various forms of energy development, agriculture, and human-induced climate change. An understanding of these relations is needed to manage the often-competing objectives of the water, energy, and food sectors in ways that ensure the long-term health of ecosystems."

"ENV 742 - Fundamentals of Working with People": {
	Professor: Stuart DeCew
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "Environmental scientists and environmental managers are working to transform environmental outcomes by changing institutional and human behavior. Research indicates time and time again that teams are important for tackling these important challenges. From developing research projects to building a business or NGO, teams can lead to better, more efficient output because they incorporate various perspectives and benefit from a wider range of skill sets. But developing and deploying effective teams is an art and a science, full of its own challenges. It requires a deep understanding of self, including one’s own strengths, blind spots, priorities, and needs. It also requires reflection, empathy, communication, and collaboration. This course aims to introduce students – particularly scientists and environmental managers – to the theory and practice of team management. Through a series of lectures, simulations, reflections, discussions, and exercises, students will increase their ability to: (1) Understand themselves and other individuals; (2) Form and lead diverse teams; (3) Influence the actions of the organizations within which they are working; (4) Collaborate with others affecting the resources about which they care."

"ENV 744 - Conservation Science and Landscape Planning": {
	Professor: Oswald Schmitz
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This advanced course applies ecological principles to understand and manage biodiversity and attendant ecosystem functioning and services in the anthropocene. The course addresses the ethical and functional basis for conservation and fosters thinking about why and how humans ought to share the planet with nonhuman life. It covers scientific principles such as evolution, life-history and the viability of species, species endangerment and extinction risk, the kinds of biodiversity, the spatial distribution of biodiversity, the functional roles of species in ecosystems, vulnerability and risk assessments, and valuing biodiversity and ecosystem services. The course applies these principles to the exploration of such topics as biodiversity’s role in the functioning and sustainability of ecological systems, restoration of environmental damages, conserving biodiversity in dynamic landscapes, adapting landscapes to climate change, balancing conservation with urban development and agriculture, and renewable energy siting. It provides students with the quantitative skills to conduct population viability analyses, geospatial analyses of the distribution of biodiversity across landscapes, vulnerability analyses, and decision analysis to balance trade-offs among multiple objectives of human land development and biodiversity conservation."

"ENV 775 - Federal Indian Law": {
	Professor: Gerald Torres
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This course covers the basics of federal Indian law. It does not address the substantive content of tribal law. Tribal law is a specialized study arising from the exercise of the legal authority that the tribes retain. This course is designed to lay the groundwork for a deep understanding of what kinds of sovereignty Indian nations may exercise within the framework of our legal system. Normally, courses of this type begin with an historical exploration of the foundations of the relations between Indian and non-Indian peoples. Instead, we begin with questions that are current and sketch out, roughly, where we are now. Typically, we start with cases pending before or recently decided by the Supreme Court. We use the Marshall Trilogy to build from the present back to the origins to see how the doctrines reflect the positive aspects of the legal expression of contact between Europe and the native nations of the Western hemisphere as well as the more malign aspects. We also situate the doctrinal evolution of federal Indian law with the struggle over colonialism as expressed in the insular cases. We do not neglect the history; it proves critical for understanding the ways in which federal Indian law is sui generis in domestic jurisprudence, but we see how that history is always haunted by the specter of colonialism, extra-legality, and finally, international legal norms. Every student must complete the discussion question requirements to sit for the examination or to submit a paper."

"ENV 839 - Power in Conservation": {
	Professor: Carol Carpenter
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This course examines the anthropology of power, particularly power in conservation interventions in the global South. It is intended to give students a toolbox of ideas about power in order to improve the effectiveness of conservation. Conservation thought and practice are power-laden: conservation thought is powerfully shaped by the history of ideas of nature and its relation to people, and conservation interventions govern and affect peoples and ecologies. This course argues that being able to think deeply, particularly about power, improves conservation policy making and practice. Political ecology is by far the best known and published approach to thinking about power in conservation; this course emphasizes the relatively neglected but robust anthropology of conservation literature outside political ecology, especially literature rooted in Foucault. It is intended to make four of Foucault’s concepts of power accessible, concepts that are the most used in the anthropology of conservation: the power of discourses, discipline and governmentality, subject formation, and neoliberal governmentality. The important ethnographic literature that these concepts have stimulated is also examined. Together, theory and ethnography can underpin our emerging understanding of a new, Anthropocene-shaped world. This course will be of interest to students and scholars of conservation, environmental anthropology, and political ecology, as well as conservation practitioners and policy makers. It is a required course for students in the combined YSE/Anthropology doctoral degree program. It is highly recommended for M.E.Sc. students who need an in-depth course on social science theory. M.E.M. students interested in conservation practice and policy making are also encouraged to consider this course, which makes an effort to bridge the gap between the best academic literature and practice. Open to advanced undergraduates. No prerequisites. Three-hour discussion-centered seminar."

	Professor: Jason Hockenberry
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This core course for the Executive M.P.H. program provides an introduction to the making, understanding, and consequences of health policy. The design and performance of the health care system are assessed, with particular attention to the complex and often contested manner in which health care is organized, financed, and delivered in the United States compared to other countries. Recorded lectures are made available to set the stage for each week’s topic(s), and we meet as a group to discuss the material and apply key concepts to the practice of health policy. The course examines the fundamental concerns—affordability, accessibility, and quality—that shape the development of health policy and health systems. Students are introduced to the key stakeholders, policy makers, institutions, and processes that influence the design and implementation of health policy and health care systems. Health issues are placed in the context of broader social goals and values, including equity; and critical trade-offs to be made while seeking such goals are discussed. To lend some coherence to our explorations, these general concerns are illustrated most consistently with health policies and programs from the United States. However, we draw from examples from other countries during several class sessions to convey how health policy and system issues play out in other nations."

"ER&M 725 - Decolonizing Europe": {
	Professor: Fatima El-Tayeb
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Decolonial theory imagines a world different from the one created by the dominance of Western modernity. However, it is not necessarily obvious what Europe can contribute to this process, as the decentering of Europe and its intellectual traditions are tenets of decolonial theory; the continent is arguably the only one in which Europeans do not appear as colonizers. In this class, following authors such as Aimé Césaire, Stuart Hall, and Houria Bouteldja, we approach Europe as a space that is key to the global process of decolonization. A return of land in the former colonies that includes actual sovereignty instead of exploitative postcolonial relationships would fundamentally change the European economy, which is built on a model of prosperity at the expense of non-Europeans, justified through a model of meritocracy that makes invisible the violence of the colonial project. But beyond that, Europe as a concept collapses without a colonial framework—what Europe stands for today (and has since early modernity) would be meaningless without the Western knowledge model that decoloniality aims to dismantle. So, what would a different, decolonized Europe look like? For potential answers, we turn to the practices of European activists and artists of color such as the French Indigènes de la République, the German Romani Phen, Spain’s Diásporas Críticas, and others. Among our themes are Europe’s investment in whiteness, museums and the question of repatriation of artifacts and human remains, queer Roma artists in Eastern Europe and the postsocialist legacy, and the so-called refugee crisis and reparations."

"HSAR 593 - The Body in Medieval Art": {
	Professor: Jacqueline Jung
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This graduate seminar explores the manifold approaches to the human body in the art and culture of medieval Christian Europe (spanning ca. 500–ca. 1500 CE, though with an emphasis on the later end of the period). Through close consideration of works in various media—mediated to us through readings, digital images/renderings, and at least one excursion—we consider both the role represented bodies played in the social life and religious imagination of medieval communities and the implications such representations had for beholders’ sense of themselves. The focus this term is on using primary sources—both textual and visual—to get at Western medieval understandings of bodies, with a special emphasis on saints and other holy people. We consider the importance of genre and convention in shaping representational possibilities and guiding patterns of expectation and response. At the same time, we attend to ways that the specificity of medium, display, and conditions of production and reception allowed for the creation of novelty and particularity in a given work. Using research tools distinctive to medievalists, such as the Index of Medieval Art, the Typologie des sources du Moyen Age occidental, and other reference works, and engaging together in close reading and visual analysis, we hone the skills that enable us to look at and listen afresh to works of medieval art, attending to their distance, strangeness, and surprise. Readings include Victricius of Rouen’s sermon In Praise of the Saints, the Passion of Sts. Perpetua and Felicity, the Passio and miracle stories of St. Foy in Conques, selections from The Golden Legend and vernacular stories that draw from it, the Lives of St. Francis of Assisi by Thomas of Celano and Bonaventura, the Life of St. Elizabeth of Thuringia and other materials from her canonization dossier, the Life of Christina the Astonishing and other writings by and about thirteenth-century charismatic women. Works of art include early Byzantine mosaics in Ravenna; the reliquary-statue of St. Foy in Conques and other vessels for body parts; French and German Gothic portal sculptures featuring scenes of martyrdom and other displays of expressivity and difference; the wall-paintings at San Francesco in Assisi; the Rothschild Canticles manuscript at the Beinecke; and various kinds of textiles that embellished living bodies."

"GLBL 5003 - Narrative Storytelling for Policy Makers": {
	Professor: David Morse
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Human beings are storytellers. We tell stories to impart to the chaos of our lives some order and meaning, or to generate empathy, or to convince others to understand some version of a particular reality. Research has shown that people remember information better—and are more inclined to believe that that the information is true—when it is presented in the form of a story, that is, with a beginning, middle, and end; characters and setting; and coherent cause and effect. In this class, we study how the craft of narrative storytelling can be deployed to further improve the public’s understanding of politics and/or a particular policy. Students identify a policy or political topic that holds their interest, conduct their own independent research to learn more about their topic, and write a public-facing feature length narrative intended to introduce the topic to a larger audience, shaping their research into a coherent and compelling story. To learn storytelling techniques—and how they might be applied to a policy context—students study a range of policy-focused narratives, learning how craft can help generate maximum effect. In addition to craft, we also study the ethical questions raised by storytelling: our lives do not resolve neatly into a story; a story, therefore, is an artificial construct. Therefore, all stories, even those based on a "true" reporting of facts, are, in a certain sense, false, capable of corrupting rather than enlightening the reader’s understanding. The final written product for the class is a policy-focused narrative of 3000+ words of the sort that might be published in outlets such as Harper’s, The Atlantic, The Believer, Guernica, or The New York Times Magazine. To apply for this course, students should specify how their interest in narratives relates to their course of study and/or career goals and describe previous experience writing narratives of any kind. If you haven't written any narratives yet, that's fine. Tell me about your previous experience writing in general (personal and/or professional). This short statement should be submitted via Yale Hub."

"GLBL 5010 - Economics for Global Affairs": {
	Professor: Amit Khandelwal
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This core course introduces students to the critical issues facing the global economy today. One of the main goals of the course is to practice how to use measurement and economic frameworks to analyze current events. The course teaches students how to apply economic reasoning to policy issues in the real world building on the concepts covered in the first-semester economics course and new concepts presented in the course.  We use these frameworks to understand questions such as: Why do some countries richer than others? How much inequality is, and should we worry about it?, How are wages and interest rates determined? How do countries conduct fiscal and monetary policy to smooth the business cycle? What determines the gains from international trade and migration? Graded only, sat/unsat option is not permissible."

"GLBL 5030 - History and Global Affairs": {
	Professor: Laura Robson
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Nobody can understand the present without a keen understanding of the past. After all, history is all we have to go on in providing the resources for making sense of the world we live in. Successful policy makers understand this and turn historical sensibility to their advantage in interpreting the present. They understand how good policy is grounded in sound historical thinking. The purpose of the core requirement is to introduce advanced students of global affairs to the manifold ways in which history is discussed and perceived today. Different from the social sciences, history as a discipline is less about prediction and more about finding out where we come from and what challenges the past has bequeathed to us. It is also about grasping, in a critical fashion, that we know the future only by the past we project into it."

	Description: "This course offers students an immersive introduction to decision-making in frontier AI labs and valuable preparation for a wide range of roles focused on emerging technology. The course is designed around an intensive, week-long simulation in which students confront many of the challenges that come with working in industry: making decisions under uncertainty, navigating fast-paced and frequently-changing information environments, and weighing up competing incentives. Students learn about a potential model release on Monday morning. Over the course of the week, they work in teams to analyze potential deployment plans and develop a recommendation for lab leadership. As the simulation unfolds, they receive new information—such as competitor activities, regulatory updates, evaluation results—that impact their analysis and decision-making. Throughout the week, students engage in interviews with industry professionals, gaining insights into research, ethics, finance, and product development perspectives. Alongside the simulation, they attend lectures and workshops to deepen their understanding."

"GLBL 6121 - Navigating Contradiction: International Organizations and China": {
	Professor: Elizabeth Knup
	Credits: 1
	Description: "China is the most influential non-democratic country in the world that exerts political and economic impact across a wide range of sectors and geographies. Today, international work requires at least a basic understanding of how China works and how international organizations work effectively with and in the country. International scholars, businesspeople, civil society practitioners, and journalists seek to understand and explain, shape and influence, and benefit from China’s rapidly developing economy and society. In so doing, these institutions and individuals encounter a political economy that defies traditional modernization theories that predict a high correlation between economic development and democratization. Rather, international actors encounter a system many scholars describe as "resilient authoritarianism," characterized by opacity and predictability, rigidity and adaptability, repression and lenience, top-down and bottom-up governance, and by rhetoric aimed at international actors that is both welcoming and defensive. Most recently, given changes in the geopolitical environment, the political atmosphere related to China in the home countries of many international organizations is also shifting, and hardening, requiring multifaceted risk analysis and risk mitigation strategies. What is the nature of the Chinese political system? How have international actors navigated the contradictions in the system over time? What is the trajectory of the Chinese political system? And what are the implications for international organizations working there? This course explores these questions through five cases studies in the fields of academic exchange, business, civil society, multilateral diplomacy, and journalism to analyze how organizations manage their operations in China to achieve their goals. The course is taught by a practitioner who managed academic exchange programs, international businesses, and global NGOs in China for twenty-five years."

"GLBL 6140 - Education Economics and Policy in Latin America": {
	Professor: Christopher Neilson
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course provides an introduction to the application of economic theory and data to the study of education policy, drawing particularly on experiences in the U.S. and Latin America. The focus is on policies that have implications for understanding inequality in education and income through the lens of the theory of human capital. The course first develops a basic economic framework that is used to understand why individuals and societies invest in their human capital. We study some reasons why education markets are different from other markets where goods and services are exchanged and what that can mean for government policy. The second part of the course reviews different policies that influence the provision and access to education services. These include how the government can subsidize and regulate the private provision of education and also organize resources to provide education services directly. In the third section of the course, we review input markets to education services, with a particular focus on teacher training and teacher labor markets. In the final part of the course, we study how access to education is structured. In many situations, prices are not used as a tool to allocate educational opportunities and this leads to other ways of determining who gets access to opportunities to invest in their human capital through education and who does not.

"GLBL 6595 - Economic Development Policy in the Twenty-First Century": {
	Professor: Amit Khandelwal
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The twenty-first century presents new challenges for the global economy including rising global and within-country inequalities, slowing globalization, the deployment of new technologies, and climate change. This course examines the design of economic policy to meet these challenges. Some of the questions we analyze include: What is the future role of manufacturing versus services in economic development? How large are the distortions caused by unequal access in labor markets for women? Why do firms in developing economies remain small, and what are their constraints on growth? Which policies distort and which improve the allocation of a country's resources? Although these topics appear disparate, the course provides a unifying framework to tackle them. Specifically, we adopt a markets-based approach that views economic development through the functioning of markets. Emphasis is placed on learning how to draw implications for economic policy from state-of-the-art research in economics."

Such "market failures" shape economic decisions at every level -- how individuals adopt new goods, how governments decide which industries to protect, and how markets direct resources to productive firms. This course focuses on market failures and their implications for policy at the firm, government, or NGO in the developing world, where market failures are most severe. We will use quantitative tools and economic analysis to understand the causes and consequences of market failures, along with how to study and design policy to respond to them."

"GLBL 6576 - Artificial Intelligence, Anti-Human Trafficking and the Ukrainian Refugee Crisis": {
	Professor: William King
	Credits: 1
	Description: "A seminar in collaboration with the United States Department of State's Diplomacy Lab and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. By January 2023, Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine caused eight million people to flee the country and nearly 5.4 million more to be displaced within its borders, affecting almost one-third of Ukraine’s population. It is estimated that around 90 percent of those who fled are women and children, with more than half of Ukraine’s children being displaced. These groups are particularly susceptible to human trafficking, both within Ukraine and abroad. Ukrainian victims are exploited in sex trafficking and forced labor not only in Ukraine but also in Russia, Poland, Germany, other parts of Europe, China, Kazakhstan, and the Middle East, with an increasing number being exploited in EU member states. Data suggests that most victims are trafficked for forced labor, but the evidence of sex trafficking and of criminal networks that exploit women and children suggest that it sex trafficking has been significantly underreported. This seminar is a consulting-style class working with the United States Department of State, Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (J/TIP), and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to develop practical solutions and strategies to assist TIP and OSCE in their current efforts against human trafficking of Ukrainian refugees. After first gaining a better understanding of human trafficking including legal frameworks, vulnerability factors, prevention and intervention strategies, students are instructed in methods to use AI and generative AI tools to detect actual signals in employment advertisements potentially intending to traffic Ukrainian refugees in Europe. Students work closely with US State and OSCE to contribute to preventing this human rights and national security crisis. Students must be prepared and able to put in the necessary time not only to learn but also to actually substantively contribute to current OSCE and US State’s efforts to detect and prevent human trafficking."

"GLBL 7035 - International Law": {
	Professor: Oona Hathaway
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course offers an introduction to international law. Students learn the basic minimum that every lawyer should know about the international dimensions of law in the modern world. The course also serves as a gateway to the rest of the international law curriculum: It offers a foundation on which students who are interested in further study of the particular topics covered in the class can later build. The course covers both the public and private dimensions of international law, offering an introduction to varied topics including international trade, international tax, international business transactions, environmental law, criminal law, human rights law, and the law of armed conflict. The course also offers an introduction to domestic law topics that intersect with international law, including foreign relations and national security law. As each new topic is introduced, the class not only examines that new topic in detail, but also explores how it relates to what the class has already discussed. By considering together topics usually taught separately, students begin to see how different subjects under the broad umbrella of international law are interconnected. And by learning about a variety of issue areas and making direct comparisons across them, students gain an understanding of each topic that can be had only by viewing it in a comparative perspective. Also LAW 21763-01."

"GLBL 7076 - National Security Policy Process": {
	Professor: Phil Kaplan
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This year-long joint Yale Law School/Yale Jackson School course is designed to facilitate student exposure to high-level national security policymakers and will address the question: "How does the national security policy process work?" Embedded in this question are subordinate questions about how that process works at different relevant departments and agencies, the answers to which look strikingly different from one to the next. The study of national security policy process touches the very structure and functions of the federal government of the United States, the national security tools at its disposal, the nature of policymaking, and its relation to law. Since its creation by statute in 1947, the National Security Council (NSC) has served as the primary forum in which the United States has engaged in national-security policymaking. The processes employed have varied across presidential administrations and different agencies. While they have been the subject of some historical inquiry, they remain in flux, and are largely opaque to the general public, even while they form an essential element for understanding some of the government’s most consequential decisions and actions."

"GLBL 7125 - Human Rights in the Americas and the Inter-American System": {
	Professor: James Cavallaro
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course provides an in-depth introduction and overview of the main human rights challenges in the Americas through the study of the context leading to abuse, as well as the engagement of the Inter-American Human Rights System (IAHRS). We begin with readings focusing on the social conflicts, inequalities, and other social factors underlying situations of rights abuse. We then turn to the IAHRS, evaluating its doctrine and practice on particular rights, as well as through a review of case studies of situations of conflict and rights abuse and the engagement of the system. The Inter-American Human Rights system is composed of two bodies: the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. The seminar evaluates the jurisprudence and practice of both bodies. The course also examines the engagement, obstacles, and opportunities the system provides for civil society groups, victims, and advocates. Class sessions consider not only the norms of the system but also its internal dynamics: these present both challenges and opportunities for advocates. In addition, we explore the influence of the system, evaluating the impact of decisions and interventions by IAHRS bodies. Students also consider the Inter-American system from a comparative perspective, comparing rulings, implementation, and impact to those of regional and universal counterparts."

"GLBL 7155 - Co-existing with Complexity: Institutional Architecture for Environmental Change": {
	Professor: Jessica Seddon
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Accelerating environmental change and its impacts on society are testing social structures at all scales. Changes in temperature patterns, storm intensity, as well as droughts, floods, and fires are intensifying and reallocating risks and stressing public and private insurance and disaster management agencies. Biodiversity loss and pollution are creating new health and economic risks. The "operating environment" around which humans have built global economic and social geographies and infrastructure is changing. This seminar focuses on the kinds of institutional architectures that will be needed to address these challenges. It is built around case studies of efforts to shape environmental outcomes but also equips students with analytical tools to identify and evaluate options for upgrading existing institutions or creating new ones. Participants in the seminar use these tools to discuss and analyze the political economy and potential effectiveness of recent proposals for new forms of transboundary environmental cooperation, climate and development finance, public-private risk allocation, environmental monitoring, and corporate and fiduciary responsibility among other responses to the visibly changing environment. The final assignment asks students to generate and defend new institutional strategies for implementing high-level commitments and principles for environmental governance."

"GLBL 7176 - US Diplomacy in Practice: Combatting Aggressive Russian Influence in Eastern Europe": {
	Professor: Dereck Hogan
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This seminar explores the formulation, implementation, and assessment of US foreign policy in response to Russian aggression in Eastern Europe. Using Moldova’s pursuit of Euro-Atlantic integration, resolution of the Azerbaijan-Armenia territorial conflict, and securing a just and peaceful end to Russia’s war in Ukraine as case studies, students examine the complexities of diplomatic strategy in a region where Russia exerts significant influence. The course emphasizes the multi-faceted nature of policy-making, from understanding geopolitical dynamics to crafting effective US responses that promote a Europe whole, free, and at peace. Students learn how to: (1) advance U.S. policy objectives in the face of Russian aggression and leverage, (2) develop and write policy memos, advocating and defending policy positions in simulated policy deliberations, and (3) master the art of effective US diplomacy through hands-on exercises that reflect real-world policy challenges and decision-making processes. By the end of the course, participants are equipped with the analytical and practical skills necessary to navigate the complexities of US-Russia relations and defend American interests in Eastern Europe through informed, strategic diplomacy."

"GLBL 7270 - Development in Action": {
	Professor: Shoshana Stewart
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course is an immersion into the "how" of international development, done through a case study of and practicum in Jordan with Turquoise Mountain, an NGO working to preserve heritage in areas of conflict. It is not meant to establish the "how to’s" but is more concerned with the messiness, the human factor, the opportunities, and the realities.  We take an in-depth look at the elements—and the complexities—of building and running successful projects, including: How do you build community support? How can you work and get things done with government bureaucracies?  How do you work with refugees and others affected by conflict? What are the elements of a sustainable financial model for programs? The practicum also allows students to work on an element of the project, which may include any parts of Turquoise Mountain’s work, from economic development, vocational training, primary education, and health, to sustainable tourism, historic building restoration, heritage, and culture. This is an opportunity for students to explore this kind of work for their career planning and to get a sense of the practical realities of development work—and whether they want to work in the field, or work alongside development projects in the future. The course begins with approximately three sessions (one in person, two over zoom) in the first half of the semester. The bulk of the work and the experience takes place over a two-week practicum, scheduled to take place over school break, in Jordan. Students who cannot spend their time off in Jordan for the course should not enroll."

"GLBL 7280 - Leadership": {
	Professor: Christopher Fussell
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course is designed for students wanting to deeply reflect on what it means to be a leader, and to help them prepare for leading others in their future. Amongst the many pressures of the role, leaders affect the lives of those they lead, influence the health of the organization they oversee, and hold an important role in advancing social progress. Many learn these realities through trial and error but are rarely given the time to consider what leadership truly entails and how we, as individual leaders, will handle the challenges that lie ahead.  From heading up a small team to running a major organization, leadership is often an isolating and uncertain position, but is also full of opportunity to positively impact others, and to advance society broadly. Leadership is challenging, exciting, and sometimes terrifying; but most importantly, it is a choice to which one must recommit every day. This course is designed to offer a foundation in the practice of leadership for students who want to take on these challenges in their future. The course is divided into three main sections: historic perspectives on leadership, leadership in context, and personal reflections on leadership. Students finish the semester with a foundational understanding of leadership models throughout history, a range of case studies to refer to in the future, and most importantly, a personal framework that can be applied and expanded throughout their journey and growth as a leader. Students do not leave with all the answers they need to conquer the countless challenges that leaders face, but they instead leave with an understanding of how leaders work, every day, to improve themselves and better the lives of those they lead."

"GLBL 7305 - Disinformation in the Age of AI": {
	Professor: Beth Goldberg
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The aim of this course is to equip students with an applied understanding of the emerging threats and potential solutions to AI-powered manipulation. Grounded in historical context, the course takes an interdisciplinary lens to the evolution of manipulative media and propaganda from the Roman empire to the near future. The consumption and production of misinformation is first studied at the level of the individual producer and consumer using recent anthropological research. Students test out cutting edge techniques from psychology (inoculation theory) and behavioral economics (nudge theory) to resist the effects of manipulation and learn how these are being applied in new technologies and regulations. Subsequent classes survey the larger economic and political forces shaping the supply and demand of misinformation, including government regulatory efforts on AI and misinformation, plus the "dark web" of unmoderated online platforms. To understand the power of new generative AI tools firsthand, students take a hands-on approach to experiment with both generative AI creation and detection."

"GLBL 7415 - New Wars, New Peace: Issues in Contemporary Conflict Resolution": {
	Professor: Federica Du Pasquier
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Conflict resolution involving hostile nations and non-state actors is facing new challenges. From bipolar to unipolar, the global landscape rapidly shifted to multipolar.  Today, and with increasing intensity, it is marked by the erosion of US influence; growing fragmentation and polarization; the rise of assertive regional powers in the Global South that oftentimes intervene militarily in their neighborhoods; and increasingly lethal forms of warfare that are decreasingly compliant with international norms. In this context, the field of conflict resolution confronts a crisis from which it has yet to emerge.  As during the Cold War, conflict parties turn to outside sponsors and outside sponsors seek to use conflict parties as proxies. Unlike during the Cold War, the multiplicity of outside actors hinders deal-making without superpowers to enforce agreements, diminishing the effectiveness of the states and international organizations that led mediation efforts a generation ago. The practice of conflict resolution has failed to adjust to a world in which global powers are still strong but not dominant, regional powers are on the rise but still with limited ability and constrained by global dynamics, and the spread of new technologies, erosion of international norms, and role predatory economic behavior in sustaining conflicts still are largely misunderstood. This course takes a closer look at these issues from an historical, thematic, but chiefly practical viewpoint. It aims to equip students with tools necessary to better understand this evolving landscape, how it affects the waging of war and efforts at peace. Students explore both successful and unsuccessful attempts at conflict resolution and draw lessons applicable to the contemporary context. The class is joined by Yale Peace Fellows, activists from around the globe who are spending a semester at Yale working on a practical project related to conflict-resolution."

"HIST 625 - Martyrdom and Sainthood in the Early Modern World": {
	Professor: Carlos Eire
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The late medieval and early modern periods saw a dramatic rise in religious violence and persecution. Heresies—such as the Hussites, Waldensians, and Lollards—unsettled religious and political authorities, leading to armed conflict and attempts to suppress movements with violence. Across northern Europe, the late Middle Ages witnessed increasing numbers of pogroms as Jewish communities continued to be eradicated. At the same time, the period saw a flourishing of the veneration of saints and the canonization of holy men and women. These conflicting trends were only heightened by the Reformation, in which martyrdom and sainthood played central roles. This course explores the willingness to die and kill for one’s faith and the extraordinary growth in religious heroes, both Protestant and Catholic, who defined emerging confessional identities. The course examines a broad range of texts and visual material considering martyrdom and sainthood in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Also REL 757."

"HIST 903 - Law and Society in Modern South Asia": {
	Professor: Rohit De
	Credits: 1
	Description: "South Asian history has taken a legal turn, with a slew of new self-conscious works of legal history and a range of ethnographies. Social scientists are opening the ways in which law, legal institutions, and ideologies structure and shape South Asian society and are becoming sites of mobilization and resistance. This marks a decisive shift away from decades of scholarship which focused on the idea of a gap between law and legal institutions and South Asian society and comes at a time when the postcolonial states of South Asia are embracing the language of decolonization to overturn and transform long-standing laws and convention. Covering a time period from the eighteenth century to the present, the course engages with the emergence of the colonial legal system and the modern legal profession. The seminar engages with both the canon and recent scholarship on South Asian law and society to rethink fundamental categories of analysis in South Asia: property, state, family, caste, capital, sex, labour, but also to think generatively across broader questions of law and society."

"HSAR 654 - Vision and Visuality in Mesoamerica": {
	Professor: Allison Caplan
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The Maya Popol Vuh recounts how, after initially making humankind with perfect vision and knowledge, the creator gods decided instead to "cloud their sight, as when a mirror is breathed upon." Vision and visuality raise key questions about how Mesoamerican people of the past understood and experienced vision as a way of knowing and interacting with the outside world. Drawing on scholarship in art history, archaeology, anthropology, and ethnography, this seminar explores how the Maya, Nahuas, Ñuu Dzavi, and other Mesoamerican peoples conceptualized and experienced vision as embodied, procreative, hierarchical, situated, and synesthetic. Further, it asks how scholars in the present can reconstruct past visualities and how doing so can provide new insights into Mesoamerican peoples’ ways of creating, understanding, and experiencing works of art and architecture."

Also practice in giving and receiving feedback is part of these First Year Only RIP classes. • First year and continuing students are given two opportunities to present to the entire cohort of all current students and the presenter’s mentors. Each student presenter is required to inform their mentors to attend. Their dates are scheduled to allow at least two months in between each student’s presentation to allow time for the student to incorporate feedback and update their work. • Spring graduation candidates are given one date to present before December as they begin to finalize their thesis. The experience of having Center for Medical Education faculty, mentors as well as senior and first-year students all together provides a rich platform for discussion of progress being made and challenges being faced. These sessions are designed to be a safe place to work together. Feedback from these discussions is intended to provide direction and practical advice to move the presenter’s project forward. It is also the intent of the R-in-Progress to give students the opportunity to practice their presentation skills with Center faculty available to observe and assist with private feedback. Guidelines for RIP sessions are distributed to all students each academic year Faculty educators are available for consults and extra help when needed along with the mentorship of the students’ chosen mentor committee. Students are provided with mentoring and support to pursue their interests in advanced education preparing them for positions in educational leadership and scholarship.

"HSCI 8900 - Interprofessional Longitudinal Clinical Experience (ILCE) Practicum Elective": {
	Professor: Alina Tsyrulnik
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "The Yale Interprofessional Longitudinal Clinical Experience (ILCE) course takes a group of first-year MD and PA students into several clinical sites throughout YNHH to practice obtaining a history and perform select portions of the physical examinations. The course entails didactics, simulation, and clinical experiences with patients. The Tutor (ILCE Practicum Elective participant) meets with a group of 4 students (combination of PA and MD ) over the course of 9 months (September-March) for a total of 14 sessions of 2 hours each. Tutors will be in a group of at least 2, and thus would only need to meet with the students for 7 sessions in the ED. These sessions are either on Monday or Friday (based on tutor preference), in the afternoon (any time starting at 1pm but ending by 6pm). Tutors will find 2-4 patients for the students to interview, and later in the course, do a limited physical while you observe and give them feedback. The Tutor will identify patients that are willing and able to have students interview them to obtain a history and then examine them. For the first half of the course, the students focus on accurate and thorough history-gathering. During the second half of the course (after December), the physical exam is added. Formative feedback will be offered throughout the experience. The students present the case to the facilitator and the rest of the group will observe the teaching and will offer feedback and help them hone their presentation skills. The group begins to generate a differential diagnosis and work-up plan with input from each student and the tutor. Direct observation is expected to aide in learning and offer feedback. Thus, facilitators should not be working clinically while they are teaching. Consequently, the facilitator will advise the scheduler to protect their schedule from clinical obligations when they are scheduled to meet with students. The facilitator will also verify that the students are aware of patient privacy regulations (HIPAA, etc.) and to lead debriefs in locations that can ensure privacy. All paper records that include HIPAA-sensitive information (e.g. EKGs, Lab result print-outs, etc) will be disposed of in appropriate receptacles and will NEVER leave the clinical, patient-care environments. Meetings with the Faculty Elective Director: The Tutor will meet with the Faculty Elective Director three times during the elective: The dates of these sessions should be decided on and scheduled before end of September. The first should be on second meeting with the students. The last should be close to the end of the course. The first two meetings will involved the faculty director direct observation of the tutor’s interaction with the students. The third meeting will include: 1) Debriefing on the entire course 2) Discussion of tutor’s final written report 3) Student feedback given to tutor throughout the course 4) Final student feedback given via Qualtrics Permission of the instructor required."

"MDVL 613 - Medieval Latin: Medieval Mystics from Bernard of Clairvaux to Thomas à Kempis": {
	Professor: John Dillon
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This reading course in Medieval Latin is intended to help students improve their command of Latin through working directly with medieval texts. We read selections from major mystics of the Middle Ages, including works by Bernard of Clairvaux (1090–1153), Hildegard of Bingen’s Scivias (ca. 1151/1152), the thirteenth-century Latin translation of Mechthild of Magdeburg’s Das fließende Licht der Gottheit (Lux divinitatis fluens, ca. 1250–80), and Thomas à Kempis’s Imitatio Christi (Imitation of Christ, ca. 1418–27)."

"MDVL 664 - History of Medieval Christianity: Learning, Faith, and Conflict": {
	Professor: Volker Leppin
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The Middle Ages have been defined by European culture as the period between 500 CE and 1500 CE. It is a period that witnesses the transformation of European Christianity into a Latin-speaking religious community under the Pope. It became increasingly separate from the developments in the Near East and Asia. All too long this epoch has served in legitimating discourses of confessions, nations and ethnic groups, such as in the nationalistic construction of the Germanic tribes. The course aims to draw a new image of these thousand years in terms of time, geography, ethnicity, gender, and culture. Medieval Christianity offers multiple possibilities for understanding both the perils and development of Christianity in an age of rapid change. On the one hand, the course examines processes of establishing power by exclusion, mainly of Jewish and Muslim believers, and of building strong hierarchies almost exclusively male. On the other hand, we find fascinating debates within Scholasticism about how to combine philosophical reason with Christian faith. Further, we explore the evolving of deep, inner spiritual practices among mystics, with special regard to female nuns, who were prolific writers. From this perspective we see how medieval Christianity is part of what we now experience as global Christianity, making a distinctive contribution to the emergence of a widely shared faith."

"MDVL 745 - Byzantine Art and Architecture": {
	Professor: Vasileios Marinis
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This lecture course explores the art, architecture, and material culture of the Byzantine Empire from the foundation of its capital, Constantinople, in the fourth century to the fifteenth century. Centered around the Eastern Mediterranean, Byzantium was a dominant political power in Europe for several centuries and fostered a highly sophisticated artistic culture. This course aims to familiarize students with key objects and monuments from various media—mosaic, frescoes, wooden panels, metalwork, ivory carvings—and from a variety of contexts—public and private, lay and monastic, imperial and political. We give special attention to issues of patronage, propaganda, reception, and theological milieux, as well as the interaction of architecture and ritual. More generally, students become acquainted with the methodological tools and vocabulary that art historians employ to describe, understand, and interpret works of art."

"MGT 528 - The Firm in the Social World: Cancel:TheFirmintheSocialWorld": {
	Professor: No professor
	Credits: N/A
	Description: ""Many classes in business school examine the market determinants of interactions between firms and between firms and consumers. In this class, we will study how social identities and interactions shape and respond to the behavior of market participants. For example, managers’ biases may affect the hiring, evaluation, and promotion of gender, racial, or religious minorities, which in turn may in turn affect the viability of the firm in the long run. Similarly, peer interactions within the firm and incentives for collaboration with or competition between team members may affect employees’ productivity and job satisfaction. To succeed, managers must navigate the social environment of the firm just as they do the market environment. This class offers a research-driven perspective on the economics of the firm in the social world. Class sessions are a mixture of lectures and student presentations of existing research. Assessment will be based on class participation, in-class presentations, two assignments, and a final project. Students should expect to read, discuss, and present research papers, and to debate firm and public policy choices. The course material draws primarily on contemporary work in labor and personnel economics. The first half of the course focuses on race and gender in the labor market. We will consider present and past differences in career and well-being outcomes by race and gender, and how deliberate discrimination and profit maximizing behavior can contribute to or mitigate these gaps. We will discuss specific management practices related to hiring, evaluation, promotion, and task structure that mediate cross-group differences, as well as how firms and workers respond to policy interventions in these processes, such as board quotas and restrictions on the information that can be used in hiring. Our goal is to develop a theoretical and empirical understanding of the economics of cross-group differences in labor market outcomes, and to highlight the limitations of existing approaches where applicable. The second half of the course focuses on teamwork, competition, and social networks in the labor market. We first consider topics related to team production, such as how managers build productive teams in settings where individual workers compete for promotions, and how inequality and pay transparency within the firm affect job satisfaction and productivity. We then turn to the analysis of networks in the context of hiring and on-the-job performance, with the goal of understanding when, why, and how network ties are valuable for firms and workers. We will combine the theory of personnel economics with applications ranging from pay equity at factories in rural India to mutual fund managers with educational ties to members of corporate boards.""

"MGT 531 - Interpersonal Dynamics": {
	Professor: David Tate
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "Attendance is required for the first two classes to retain a place in the course or on the waiting list. This course has a mandatory weekly lab meeting most Tuesdays from 6:30p-9:30p. This course also has a mandatory off-campus weekend retreat (see dates below). Studies have shown that the average manager spends about two-thirds of their time interacting with others. It should be no surprise that skill in interpersonal relationships is one of the most frequent determinants of managerial success or failure. This course is designed to help students learn some of the skills necessary for successfully navigating and leading in the face of fast-paced, complex human interaction. The central focus is to increase students' ability to understand and diagnose interpersonal dynamics as well as to increase personal understanding of how they impact others. This course is a memory-making, powerful and even transformational experience for many students. While readings and group exercises are used to begin discussion, the core learning material emerges in small group interaction. Students learn how they function in small groups and how they relate to others from feedback and reaction of other class members. As such, students planning to enroll should understand that the course methodologies are likely quite different than most courses you have taken to date. Much of the learning will emerge from a) personal reflection on interpersonal and group dynamics and b) the ability/willingness to learn interpersonally from experience, risk-taking, self-disclosure, and feedback. Interested students are encouraged to attend first session to better understand this unique course experience. Attendance is required for the first two classes to retain a place in the course or on the waiting list. This course has a mandatory weekly lab meeting most Tuesdays from 6:30p-9:30p. This course also has a mandatory off-campus weekend retreat scheduled for November 1st at 6 pm – to November 3rd at 3 pm, 2024. Outside of the required course meetings, reading and writing- almost all of the course demand takes place in person. More information available at https://faculty.som.yale.edu/heidibrooks/"

We will emphasize use of quantitative methods to analyze consumer feedback and product usage data to inform PM decisions. We will cover specific PM issues across startup-stage, growth-stage, and enterprise-stage firms. Examples include how startups can achieve product-market fit, convert consumer needs to MVPs, and assess traction and when to pivot; how growth-stage firms can prioritize features, balance competing strategic objectives, and develop channels that scale to new markets; and how enterprise firms can conduct systematic product innovation and optimize products at scale. The course will provide hands-on opportunities to apply course material on real PM problems from leading technology firms. We will accordingly cover technical skills required of PMs, including basics of technology-driven products (e.g., the software stack and modern cloud ecosystem); the interplay with design, UI/UX, and product marketing; and how to develop statistical hypotheses and conduct A/B tests.""

"MGT 611 - Policy Modeling": {
	Professor: Faidra Monachou
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "Policy modeling refers to applications of operations research and allied quantitative methods to policy problems. Policy modeling is most useful when the amounts of data, money, time, and other resources one would like for purely scientific investigation are highly constrained by the decision-making environment. Recognizing that analyses of all sorts often exhibit diminishing returns in insight to effort, the idea is to capture key features of various policy issues with relatively simple "first-strike" models that provide support for decision making. Building on earlier coursework in probability modeling, decision analysis and economics, the techniques introduced include "back of the envelope" probabilistic models such as Bernoulli, Poisson, Markov and elementary renewal processes, hazard functions, queueing theory, and epidemic modeling. Simple cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness approaches are integrated with the above. This year the course will feature several applications to the prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2, the causal virus of COVID-19, in addition to problems drawn from other areas of public health, criminal justice, public housing, and counterterrorism. Students will be responsible for attending lectures and reading assigned articles. There will be weekly problem sets which must be submitted on-time to receive credit, and a take-home exam scheduled for the latter part of the semester. Prerequisite: Students must have completed MGT 403 (Probability Modeling and Statistics) or equivalent to take this class. The probability modeling knowledge required is covered in any introductory probability course and includes: sample space, event probabilities including marginal, joint and conditional, Bayes' Rule, random variables, probability distributions, expected value, mean, variance, Bernoulli, binomial, uniform, and normal random variables, joint distributions, independence, covariance and correlation, sums of random variables (both independent and dependent), central limit theorem, and sampling distributions.

The subject matter will embrace and integrate such broad key dimensions of strategic change as economic context, shifting markets, emerging technologies, corporate life stage, company culture, and corporate governance together with the character, skill-set, and life stages of individual leaders. The course mission involves three equally important goals. The first is to help students anticipate the multi-dimensional cross-disciplinary aspects of successful planned change from strategic systems to group dynamics and individual psychology. A second is to appreciate the consequences of the unintended effects of strategic change initiatives on work communities and societies at-large. The last is to provide students with an overview of the contemporary industry-specific challenges in an effort to highlight the varied leadership values and skills that are not always apparent as corporations make acquisitions or managers select careers. The course materials used to fulfill this mission require students to be comfortable with a wide variety of learning tools including: research articles; case studies; current industry periodicals; spirited class discussion; role playing; video; and frequent prominent industry leaders as class visitors. Following an overview that builds an analytic framework for the course, the key dimensions of strategic change will be examined through a sequence of industry-by-industry settings including: professional services; financial services; retail; e-commerce; communications and media; recreation and travel; government and nonprofit; industrial and consumer products. Toward the close, the course will return to cross-industry change leadership and challenges such as executive succession, life stage imperatives, and ethical dilemmas.

	Credits: N/A
	Description: ""Trust in science among the public is at a recent-historic low, and there are powerful forces working to keep it that way. If experts do not actively engage in the information landscape, their work risks being undone or lost. If they interact in the wrong ways, they could end up only contributing more to the chaos and division that currently characterize the information landscape. Opting out is not an option; we all have public faces now, and the question is how best to develop and utilize them. Given the state of division and distrust that threaten science, it should likely be among the aspirations of every graduate with an interest in healthcare management, science, medicine, and/or public health to have some part in shaping narratives that promote health and fact-based discourse over angry, divisive stagnation. This course invites students to study ways in which it can be done, and to reflect on their own potential, and to try out different techniques and different platforms—to begin to find their public voice. To see what works for some messages and some communicators, and what fails, and why. The course will introduce and study the increasingly broad array of tools to engage in public discourse, to reach people outside of their immediate circles of professional contacts, and to influence the lives of many. It is predicated on the idea that science cannot be conceived as a system by which knowledge emanates outward (much less downward) from academia, or it will cease to reach people and to affect the world, but only exacerbate distrust and claims of elitism. Rather science can only exist as an active process of communication between researchers and the public. This is how trust is built and the learning process is most effective, as a mutual, shared endeavor. This is a widely held conception of science, and yet the actual methods of such engagement are overlooked or ignored by many in the health sciences. This course is not prescriptive, but is meant to engage critically with modes of communication and shaping discourse. The course will equip students to critically analyze emerging methods of health-oriented communication. It will offer a survey of many approaches wherein students will develop an understanding of the canonical paths to writing for large audiences (op-eds, long-form journalism)—as well as explore how narratives emerge over time in much smaller and more personal scales. We will study the role that experts play in creating media on their own platforms and by working with media outlets as either sources or contributors, consultants or editors or publishers. It is critical that not all experts communicate in the same styles and on the same platforms. Writing an op-ed in The New York Times is valuable, for example, but the ability to do that is just one tool in what needs to be an arsenal of ways of reaching people across cultural, socioeconomic, ideological, intellectual, and educational backgrounds.""""

"MGT 842 - Financing Green Technologies": {
	Professor: Richard Kauffman
	Credits: N/A
	Description: ""Is Green the new Gold? At least in renewable energy, the last 35 years have seen booms followed by spectacular busts. While the recent collapse of several renewable energy companies--including the much publicized Solyndra--may suggest that this cycle is not much different than the last, many entrepreneurs are still forming green companies. In addition, the ranks of climate change skeptics grows ever thinner in spite of the increase in political partisanship around climate change and renewable energy. This course will explore how investing in renewable energy is different than in investing in more prosaic sectors. These differences include capital intensity, commodity markets, mature industry structure, local and federal regulation, and market imperfections. The course will also review the differences in policy support given to renewable energy in other countries. While the emphasis is on renewable energy, many of the same issues obtain in considering other green technologies—from water to new packaging. The course will rely on real-life case studies to illustrate themes and to expose students to different end markets and to companies along the maturity cycle from early stage ventures to projects using mature technology. In so doing, the course will give some insights as to specialized participants --VC, Private Equity, and Project Finance—fit together in funding a company. Students should expect to leave the class better prepared to address major issues and seize new opportunities in clean energy finance. While the course will use the lens of an investor, most of the issues are the same from the standpoint of a business owner seeking to finance renewable energy activities and a policy maker seeking to encourage capital formation in the sector. Non-SOM students who have background in finance and in business strategy are encouraged and welcome to participate with permission of the instructor.""""

What types of financial fraud are most prevalent? How are they revealed? What red flags should one look for? What lessons can we derive from the study of past financial frauds to inform our use of forensic tools to uncover future frauds? How does financial euphoria and its self-momentum undermine caution, staunch skepticism, and encourage misperceptions? What is "control" fraud? Does "legal" fraud exist in finance?"

By analyzing the evolution of both traditional media (such as print and broadcast) and digital-first platforms (including online publishing and streaming), the course provides a broad understanding of how these outlets are adapting to better serve this fast-growing and influential market segment. Students will explore the business models, leadership approaches, and competitive strategies of U.S.-based minority-owned companies, multicultural divisions within mainstream media conglomerates, and international content providers as they navigate this expanding market, which is poised to generate over $28 billion in revenues this year. Through case studies, industry analysis, and multimedia resources, students will explore how these companies navigate the challenges of audience engagement, technological change, and content monetization"

"MGT 892 - Introduction to Financial Crisis Communications": {
	Professor: Rosalind Wiggins
	Credits: N/A
	Description: ""Financial crises do not occur often, but when they do occur, they can have devastating impact on the financial system and economy. The dynamics of financial crises share dynamics with other types of crises but also entail unique characteristics. And government agencies are key participants as well private companies. Repeatedly policymakers and media have lamented that the government could have done a better job communicating during the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2009 (GFC). However, the traditional literature of crisis communication says little about preparing for or managing a financial crisis. In this course you will learn the basic theories of crisis communications and the various communication frameworks and techniques used to respond to crises. With this knowledge, we will then look closely at communications during industry crises and then financial emergencies and crises (and in particular the GFC) to discern what are appropriate communications frameworks for preparing for and addressing a systemic financial crisis.""""

"MGT 896 - America’s Future Role in the Global Economy": {
	Professor: Jeffrey Garten
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "The class meets on Thursdays, 1:00 - 4:00 p.m. beginning on January 23, 2025. This course is open to all Yale graduate students as well as Yale College seniors. In order to enroll in this course you must attend the first class meeting on January 23 in its entirety. Also, please note that there is a homework assignment due before the first class. Auditing is not permitted. Course description: This course will be co-taught by Jeffrey E. Garten and Robert D. Hormats, whose combined experience spans the Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Clinton, and Obama administrations, as well as decades on Wall Street. The course is based on the premise that America’s role and policies in the global economy are undergoing a profound change that will outlast the current administration in Washington. It will examine the major forces in the U.S. and abroad that will be determining America’s future in the global economy and the likely policies it will follow for the next decade. These will include changes in the country’s industrial and financial structures, new social pressures, new demographic patterns, and evolving political alignments. Typical of the kinds of questions to be examined will be: How will the changing labor force affect America’s interest in the global arena? How will changing technology affect these interests? What about changes in energy and the environment? What will trade policy, policy toward foreign investment and immigration policy look like? How should we think about the changing roles of Wall Street, Corporate America, and Silicon Valley? Regarding developments abroad, we will ask questions such as these: How will China’s evolving interests, or new directions for the European Union, or the changing position of big emerging markets, or new pressures in global finance influence American policy, and with what effect? If the U.S. attempts to reduce its international involvement, who will write and try to enforce the "rules of the game?" Given the centrality of the United States to the global economy, the course will be important global background for future leaders in any profession."

"MUS 587 - Reframing 20th- and 21st-Century Music and Music Analysis": {
	Professor: Stephanie Venturino
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "4 credits. NP. Group A. What might we discover by looking at contemporary repertoire through the lens of lesser-known composers and compositional processes? What happens if we shift our focus from traditional tools for post-tonal analysis—pitch-class set theory and twelve-tone theory—to embrace broader, more descriptive methods? This course grapples with these questions head-on, offering a decentered approach to engaging with 20th- and 21st-century art music. Students will develop analytical tools and strategies, as well as consider problems of canonicity and tonal-atonal boundaries. Topics include modes, scales, pitch organization, rhythm, repetition, timbre, tuning, and gesture. Repertoire covers a wide variety of styles and instrumentations; composers include Ruth Crawford Seeger, Roque Cordero, Kaija Saariaho, Unsuk Chin, Sky Macklay, Anna Thorvaldsdottir, George Lewis, Dai Fujikura, Pamela Z, and Tanya Tagaq, among others. Brief excerpts of scholarly prose help students relate score study to broader musical, historical, cultural, and political trends. Course requirements include weekly listening, reading, and analytical work; occasional oral presentations and discussion board assignments; and a final analysis project based on student-selected repertoire."

	Description: "4 credits. NP. Group A or B. A study of form, texture, and affect in piano trios from the origins of the genre until the end of World War II. Beginning with examples from the late eighteenth century, the course charts a path through some of the most important developments of the next 160 years: chromatic harmony, formal and temporal experimentation, post-tonal idioms, and narrative and programmatic content. A parallel concern is the composer’s response to evolving instruments and changing performance practices. Repertoire is chosen in part according to students’ interests and current performance projects. Among composers addressed are Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert, Wieck, Schumann, Brahms, Dvorák, Ravel, Clarke, Ives, and Shostakovich."

Gabrieli."
}
"MUS 605 - Poetry and Meaning in Vocal Music": {
	Professor: Paul Berry
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "4 credits. NP. Group A or B. This course surveys major vocal genres in Western traditions, from the Middle Ages to the present, in search of sensitive and flexible approaches to the relationship between music and the poetry it sets. Among practicing musicians and scholars alike, vocal works are commonly understood as transparent vessels for verbal meaning, which, itself, is often presented as straightforward and fixed. Yet any poem rewards a range of complementary, even contrasting interpretations, while composers in different genres and periods have developed an array of musical procedures that enhance, inflect, deflect, or entirely redefine the meanings that a given text can convey to receptive audiences. Beginning with the foundations of notated European music in chant and monophonic song, and proceeding through detailed score study of examples from essential vocal genres (motet, cyclic mass, madrigal, opera, cantata, oratorio, song, song cycle, and popular song), this course hones a variety of strategies for the analysis of texted music. Repertoire will be chosen partly in response to student interest and current performance projects. Possibilities include chant and monophonic song by Hildegard von Bingen and Beatriz de Dia; motets and masses by Vitry, Josquin, Willaert, Lassus, Palestrina, Vittoria, Poulenc, Reich, and Pärt; madrigals and monody by Arcadelt, Wert, Marenzio, Monteverdi, Strozzi, and Ligeti; cantatas by Bach and Stravinsky; operas and oratorios by Schütz, Handel, Mozart, and Hindemith; electro-acoustic works by Babbitt and Saariaho; songs and song cycles by Dowland, Moulinie, Schubert, Schumann, Brahms, Ives, Burleigh, Price, Britten, and Walker; and popular songs and albums by Sam Cooke, Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, and Kendrick Lamar. Close readings of poetic texts go hand-in-hand with score study; brief excerpts from primary sources and scholarly prose provide historical context and conceptual cognates, including rhetoric, narrative, and the complex influences of gender, race, sexuality, and political identity on the composition and interpretation of vocal music. Course requirements include weekly listening and short readings, occasional oral presentations (4-6 minutes) and brief response papers (1-2 pages), a final project (a 4-page paper, a curated performance, or a model composition), and a final oral examination on topics chosen by the student."

	Credits: N/A
	Description: "4 credits. NP. Group B. How are we to perform music from the Baroque era (ca. 1600–1750)? The diverse styles of the instrumental and vocal music composed during this period elicit widely differing responses from instrumentalists and singers attuned to pre-Classical and Romantic performance practices. In this course, which is centered on both performance and discussion, we take in the many possibilities available to the performer of music composed in this period. The topics we explore include Baroque sound, rhetoric, ornamentation and improvisation, vibrato, text-music relationships, tempo and meter, rhythmic alteration, dynamics, pitch, temperament, editions, and basso continuo. We compare period instruments to their modern counterparts through live performance and recordings as well as discuss differences in national styles throughout this period."

"MUS 653 - American Mavericks in Concert Music, 1970–Present": {
	Professor: Chris Theofanidis
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "4 credits. NP. Group A or B. This course looks at the arc of American experimentalism over the course of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries and is offered over two terms (though each of the two courses may be taken without the other as a prerequisite). John Cage wrote that "an experimental action is one the outcome of which is not foreseen." The musicologist David Nicholls distinguishes experimentalism from the avant-garde thus: "…very generally, avant-garde music can be viewed as occupying an extreme position within the tradition, while experimental music lies outside it." A vibrant strain of experimental American thought, often free of the sense of a directional "lineage" found in European modernism, is full of iconoclastic and passionate thinking, and worthy of study. This second term of the course focuses on music from the early 1970s to the present."

This course is designed to build a conceptual bridge from the life of a student musician to that of a professional artist. In this course students will develop an artist statement that identifies the various ways they make music, the motivation and inspiration behind their music making, their aspirational goals for how they might maintain and expand their pursuits in the future, and the related interests and passions already developing adjacent to their musical abilities. Through a variety of readings and class discussion, students will build a foundational understanding of entrepreneurship and use that knowledge to establish a framework for identifying potential career paths. The artist statement will serve as the inspiration for the development of a career plan detailing how they wish to pursue an entrepreneurial path in and/or adjacent to music.

}
"REL 622 - Sacrifice: Violence, Ritual, and Redemption": {
	Professor: Andrew McGowan
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "Sacrifice is a basic feature of the Jewish and Greco-Roman religious traditions among which Christianity emerged, as well as a cross-cultural phenomenon. Study of sacrifice has been central to the emergence of modern social theory, as well as a basic theme for Christian theology. Yet the meaning and purpose of sacrifice, ancient or modern, is contested; even the assumption that there is any single or essential idea or practice to which "sacrifice" stably and consistently refers is debatable. This course considers what sacrifice is or was in the specific setting of Mediterranean antiquity and early Christianity. After considering sacrificial traditions in early Judaism and classical Greek and Roman sources, it considers how early Christianity used, transformed, and invented ideas and practices related to sacrifice. Attention is given to how foundations for continuing understanding of Eucharist, atonement, and other issues were laid, and to significant theoretical perspectives on sacrifice in anthropological and theological discourse, ancient and modern. Area I and Area II."
}
"REL 626 - Systematic Theology": {
	Professor: Willie Jennings
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This is a course in systematic theology, which means it is a course that examines the theological practices of Christian faith. It is the practice of thinking inside the practices of the faith that constitutes the idea of "system" in this course. To that end, this course considers three categories of practice: the practice of worship, the practice of ministry, and the practice of witness, roughly aligning with the threefold identity-ministry of Jesus, as prophet, priest, and king. The task of thinking inside these practices brings us to doctrines that have formed at the sites of these practices and which in turn help to shape the practices. This task also brings us to forms of Christian communal life that are facilitated by these practices and that, in turn, situate these practices in their reason for being. Area II."
}
"REL 641 - The World of Karl Barth": {
	Professor: Willie Jennings
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This course explores the theology of Karl Barth who is without dispute one of the most important theologians of the twentieth century. He represents one of the crucial moments of modern theology’s self-reflection and for us a conceptual site to explore several pressing issues including, (a) the nature of Christian theology, (b) theology as a social performance, (c) the relation of liberal and conservative social and theological conceptualities, (d) the role of tradition in the theological imagination, and (e) the modern racial conditions within which theology is done. We also consider the global context out of which Barth does his work (the colonial world that shapes him), the theology he performs (the world he creates), and the theological legacy he has left to us (the world of his interpreters). Our goal in this course is to gain a precise sense of the theological world, after Barth. Area II."

	Professor: Melanie Ross
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "Vatican II denounced the "split between the faith which many profess and their daily lives," characterizing it as "among the more serious errors of our age" (Gaudium et Spes, no. 43). How does our experience in the Sunday liturgy relate to the way we live our lives in the "real world"? Is such a distinction between sacred and secular valid? What about the problematic fact that worship is often used to reinforce political and ethical status quos? This course investigates how several contemporary thinkers have addressed these concerns through their liturgical and sacramental theologies. Area II."
}
"REL 658 - Sacraments and Sacramentality": {
	Professor: Melanie Ross
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "What is a sacrament? How might material reality be a sign and bearer of the sacred? What are the logics that govern this possibility? This class explores sacraments within ecclesial structures and notions of sacramentality more broadly as a mode of access to divine presence. The first half of the course examines the history of sacramental theology before pivoting to contemporary theologies of sacraments and sacramentality. Special attention is given to the natural world and human bodies as sites of sacramentality. Area II."
}
"REL 662 - The Anglican Way I": {
	Professor: Hannah Black
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This course explores the origins and development of the Anglican way of being Christian, focusing attention on two case studies: the Church of England and the Episcopal Church, from the English Reformation (sixteenth century) through "The Colenso Affair" (nineteenth century). The course is a companion to REL 663, making a two-term study of the historical evolution and theological traditions of the Anglican way of being Christian. The primary aim of the course is to analyze and make a constructive theological assessment of early Anglican traditions and to explore these as a pastoral and spiritual resource for Christian life and ministry. We do this by engaging in the study of both well-known and lesser-studied texts and figures. In addition to lectures, each week we discuss the respective texts, interrogating them with respect to the distribution of power, questions arising from colonialism, and issues relevant to the formation of the global Anglican Communion. We ask the questions: What does it mean to be Christian in the Anglican Way, and how do we do Anglican theology? How do we approach the study of the Anglican story in light of the dialectic between the Catholic and contextual, secular and Church, universal and particular, the global and the local? To what extent is the Anglican Way an exercise in depolarization? Area II and Area III."

}
"REL 681 - Imago Dei and Human Dignity": {
	Professor: No professor
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "Christian conceptions of human dignity are very often explicated in terms of human creation in the image of God. But human dignity can be conceived of in terms either of inherent capacities or in terms of bestowed worth, and the imago dei plays a different role in these two conceptions. Moreover, it is not clear that all understandings of the imago dei lend themselves to undergirding claims to universal human dignity. Nor is it clear that the discourse of human dignity has served to advance human equality, rather than reinforcing the power and privilege of certain groups. In the first half of this course, we consider structural, relational and functional, and developmental understandings of the imago dei as these have emerged in the Christian tradition and consider how these are transformed in the context of Western liberal modernity. In the second half of the course, we turn to contemporary discussions of human dignity against this backdrop and consider the ways in which these debates inform contemporary thought, touching on questions of race, human rights, and bioethics. We discuss secular critiques of the notion of human dignity, secular analogues to Christian conceptions, and a range of Christian responses. Authors range from Augustine, Locke, Kant, and Frederick Douglass to Waldron, Nussbaum, and Kelsey. Area II."

	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This course looks at the broad structural development of the Eucharistic liturgy at certain key epochs in the history of the Christian Church. However, its main focus is on the central prayer of the rite, the Eucharistic Prayer or Great Thanksgiving. It examines the theories put forward regarding its possible origins, its historical development, its treatment by the various sixteenth- and seventeenth-century reformers, and subsequent epochs to the present. It reflects on the theologies expressed in this prayer genre and considers the corresponding sacramental theology in doctrinal writings on the Eucharist, East and West, as well as contemporary discussion.

	Professor: Jennifer Herdt
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This course offers a selective exploration and assessment of Christian political theologies from the mid-twentieth-century to the present, attending to how contemporary reflection on the relation between civil political life and the life of the church is constituted in relation to biblical, patristic, and medieval understandings of church and society even as it comes to terms with the modern nation state, secularization, and an emerging post-secular reality. We consider the continuing legacy of natural law approaches, competing Augustinian political theologies, and liberation theology’s contribution to shifting attention away from the nation state to the agency of the oppressed and marginalized. Finally, we examine how our own post-Christian and post-secular moment opens up new possibilities for Christian politics beyond either accepting the privatization of faith and the subordination of the church or denouncing modernity and the secular. Area II and Area V."

"REL 704 - History MAR Thesis Prospectus Preparation": {
	Professor: Bruce Gordon
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "The purpose of this course is for students writing their thesis in history of Christianity to prepare a prospectus. A prospectus is a document (twelve to fifteen pages) that outlines the aims of the project, the historiographical background, identifies the essential primary sources, and develops a research plan. For those doing the professional thesis, this includes plans for their form of presentation (webpage, exhibition, video, etc). The goal is for the prospectus to prepare the student to begin work on the research and writing of their thesis. The course has three closely related parts. First, a series of seminars is conducted with visiting faculty and graduate students to discuss the nature and scope of the prospectus and give advice on strategies. The second part is independent work on the prospectus that students carry out under the guidance of their adviser. The third part is a series of workshop sessions at which students present their projects as they develop and have the opportunity to discuss the work of others. At the end of the term, students present and submit their prospectus. Area III."

"REL 706 - John Chrysostom": {
	Professor: Mark Roosien
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "John Chrysostom (347–407) was one of the most prolific preachers and authors of late antiquity. Preaching in the important cities of Antioch and Constantinople, he was a major orator, thinker, and celebrity. The role of the preacher, in his mind, was primarily psychagogical: to form his congregation to grow in virtue both personally and collectively, both in public and at home. John’s program of personal and social formation through preaching was vast and varied. Engaging with the latest scholarship on John Chrysostom and early Christian studies more broadly, this course investigates three primary issues: text and audience, ritual public and domestic, and the natural environment.  Area II and Area III."

The course surveys stories and research on the development of religious identity, examines how interreligious relationships and communities are formed, and considers theological and practical rationales and methods. Within traditions, we explore problems of representation and diversity. Between religious traditions, we examine white Christian privilege in America and sources of religious discrimination and conflict. The class defines the qualities of effective interfaith relationships and identifies common mistakes leaders can make. Guest religious leaders from different religious traditions make presentations, students conduct interviews across traditions, and a final project seeks to create an interfaith community education experience.

"REL 719 - Christianity and Coloniality in Contemporary Africa": {
	Professor: No professor
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "Missionary complicity with the colonial enterprise puts Christianity at the heart of the problematic relationship between the African continent and the West. At the same time, Christianity has continued to grow rapidly in post-independence Africa. In much of Africa south of the Sahara, decolonization efforts coincided with the period of the greatest Christian expansion in history. Africa is now the continent with the highest population of Christians. This course examines this conundrum through critical engagement with theory, literature, and data from the continent. Students explore historiographic, political, social, economic, and demographic dimensions of this discussion. They meet key theories posited with regard to African Christianity in the wake of a colonial history. The course surveys contemporary issues in the discourse within the urban, educational, social, and cultural spheres. Students also consider gender perspectives on coloniality as it pertains to religion and politics. The course assesses the role of indigenous agency in the development of Christianity within contemporary Africa. Through this course students gain a more nuanced perspective as they examine and problematize critical arguments in the prevailing discourse on Christianity and coloniality in Africa today.

"REL 746 - Religion and Rebellion in Latin America": {
	Professor: No professor
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "The 2013 election of Pope Francis and the pontiff’s subsequent emphasis on the Catholic Church’s preferential option for the poor has brought the "rebellious" history of liberation theology into the global spotlight. The media frequently portrays liberation theology as a simple fusion of religious beliefs and political ideologies, particularly Marxist ideologies, and observers often assume that the movement represented an abrupt break with the region’s conservative religious past. However, Latin America has a long and complex history of religious "rebellion" or "resistance" (terms whose very meaning will be interrogated in this seminar), especially among marginalized members of Latin American society, such as indigenous persons, Afro-Latin Americans, women, and the poor. In the more than 500 years since Christopher Columbus first arrived in Caribbean waters, indigenous religious leaders spearheaded rebellions against colonial authorities, enslaved Muslim Africans coordinated revolts against their enslavers, a Brazilian "holy man" convinced the impoverished inhabitants of rural Brazil to confront the armed forces of an entire nation, and Mexican Catholics shouted ¡Viva Cristo Rey! as they rose up against what they believed to be an oppressive and godless regime. The history of religious rebellion in Latin America is as diverse as it is extensive. Catholicism, Protestantism, Islam, Vodou, and indigenous religions all played parts in rebellions that could be progressive, conservative, nationalist, or separatist in nature. This seminar draws upon this diverse religious history to examine and discuss a number of questions, including: How do we identify and define religious resistance? When and why do we declare a religious rebellion successful? How has the notion of a Latin American utopia changed over time, and how has this affected the nature of religious rebellion? Has the growth of religious pluralism in Latin America intensified or diluted efforts of religious resistance? Area III and Area V."

	Professor: Maytal Saltiel
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This course explores various approaches to college and university chaplaincy found in the United States in the twenty-first century. Drawing on a historical framework for the role of chaplaincy in the college setting from the middle of the twentieth century (when secularism became a heavier influence), and exploring the issues that enhance the vocation in a pluralistic context of the twenty-first century, the course provides an overview of strategies needed to offer a creative, current, and engaging chaplaincy in higher education. Through a series of lectures, open discussions, site visits, short chaplaincy narratives, guest speakers, and hands-on creative projects involving extensive group work, the class encounters numerous perspectives and approaches. The course is dedicated to the examination of individual points of view from college and university chaplains from various faith traditions and in different settings (i.e., small liberal arts schools, historically Black colleges, large research institutions, church-based schools) from across the country. These viewpoints also provide seeds for a deeper discussion of issues such as race, class, gender, and sexual orientation within college and university chaplaincies. Area IV and Area V."

"REL 823 - Trauma, Moral Injury, and Crisis Ministry": {
	Professor: Joyce Mercer
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This course invites participants into the study of three distinct but overlapping forms of human suffering. Trauma is a person’s experience of threat to one’s being and/or identity that exceeds resources for coping with the threat, and which resists integration. Moral injury has been identified more recently by scholars and clinicians as a psychological wound involving violation of conscience/deeply held values, either by someone in a position of legitimate authority or by one’s self, in a high-stakes situation. Crises are turning-point moments of extreme difficulty or distress that bring to the foreground fundamental questions about life matters such as relationships, purpose/vocation, and the existence and presence of God in human affairs. Engaging practical theology’s multidisciplinary approach to these three complex phenomena, we utilize perspectives from theology, psychology, sociology, biology, cinema, and art as frameworks for understanding and responding. We learn and practice basic skills of crisis intervention and trauma-informed pastoral care. Topics include collective trauma, transgenerational trauma transmission, PTSD, "secondary" trauma, post-traumatic growth, crisis theory, suicide, memorialization, and pastoral care in disasters.

"REL 834 - Preaching for Introverts": {
	Professor: Donyelle McCray
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "While preaching is a public practice, some of history’s most influential preachers were introverts. How did they manage the demands given their innate constitutions? How can contemporary introverts approach the practice while being true to themselves? This course explores preaching strategies for introverts. Finding ways to make the depth of one’s spiritual insights accessible to others is the central task. Students examine strategies for engaging scripture, composing sermons, and relating with listeners. Since conceptions of introversion are largely undergirded by the preacher’s identity and relationship to broader cultural contexts, this course gives considerable attention to the ways race and gender inform introversion and include strategies for integrating embodied knowledge and cultural identity. Ultimately, students find ways to proclaim vibrant messages that stir passion for the gospel. Area IV."

"REL 941 - Chinese and Japanese Christian Literature": {
	Professor: Chloe Starr
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "What effect did Christianity have on modern Chinese literature, and what sort of Christianity emerges from Chinese Christian literature? Is Endō Shusakū the only Japanese Christian writer (and does Martin Scorsese’s film do justice to Endō's novel Silence)? This course tackles such questions by tracing the development of a Christian literature in China and Japan from late Imperial times to the beginning of the twenty-first century, with particular focus on the heyday (in China) of the 1920s and ’30s, and on the Japanese side, on Endō's postwar novels. Using texts available in English, the course examines how Christian ideas and metaphors permeated the literary—and revolutionary—imagination in East Asia. Though rarely clearly in evidence, the influence of Christianity on Chinese literature came directly through the Bible and church education and indirectly through translated European and Western literature. The course tests the aesthetic visions and construction of the human being from texts set among Japanese samurai in Mexico to the revolutionary throes of modern China. Area V."

The course’s overall consideration is how an educational leader trained at YDS can effectively "minister" to students, colleagues, and other members of school communities. Readings and discussions cover a range of topics including the tradition of faith-based education, school mission, pedagogy, worship, service programs, and ethical leadership in the "business" of schools (admissions, budgets, fundraising). The seminar also makes extensive use of case studies and simulations. For the major research project, each student pursues a topic of particular interest related to schools and educational leadership. Research includes direct experience, fieldwork/campus visits, and review of scholarship. Issues of race, class, gender, and sexuality arise in connection with topics considered in this seminar.

	Description: "This course is designed as an exploration of the discourses, practices, institutions, and structures that have shaped and continue to shape Judaism as a tradition and Jews as a social group. Its goal is to provide students substantive engagement with the Jewish tradition and with the Jewish historical experience. Like other "religious civilizations," Judaism cannot be reduced to a clear, unchanging set of beliefs, practices, and values. What Judaism is or should be has always been a matter of contention, even as the answers have changed over time and across context. The course is thus organized around a series of questions or problems with which Jews—and the study of Judaism—have perennially wrestled. Area V."
}
"REL 935 - Environmental and Multispecies Justice": {
	Professor: Ryan Darr
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "The central aim of this seminar is to explore the question of whether the notion of justice, especially as it has been understood in the Christian tradition, can be expanded to include environmental factors and nonhuman species. The course is divided into three parts. The first part offers a brief survey of the history and present state of Western philosophical and theological work on justice. The second part covers important works on environmental justice, climate justice, and multispecies justice written across several disciplines in recent years. The final part returns to Christian theology and ethics, asking whether and how it can make sense of issues related to environmental, climate, and multispecies justice. It focuses on the work of two theologians—Tink Tinker and Pope Francis—as well as a fictional eco-Christian sect depicted by Margaret Atwood. The nature and scope of justice will be the central theoretical question of the course. While exploring the possibilities for an expanded vision of justice, we also keep open the possibility that justice is an inadequate concept for thinking ethics beyond the human. We also discuss other possibilities, including notions of kinship, relationality, reciprocity, and balance developed especially in Indigenous and feminist thought. This class is an ethics seminar centered on conceptual questions about the possibilities and limits of justice. Given its relevance to present issues facing policymakers, activists, and other practitioners, the course includes an option for engaging in a more practical register. Students choosing the practical "track" are involved with an environmental, climate, or animal justice organization during the semester and have modified assignments that engage their work with the organization.

	Professor: Abdul-Rehman Malik
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "How does the Islamic tradition address race, gender, sexuality, and power? In what ways does that tradition see itself as a means for spiritual, social, political, and economic liberation, seeking the establishment of just, merciful, and compassionate societies? How do contemporary Muslim theologians, thinkers, scholars, and jurists interrogate and engage the classical tradition at these "intersections"? How are Muslims asserting their faith through the expression of these often overlapping identities? These are the key lines of inquiry this course pursues. It is designed as a survey course—comprehensive, not exhaustive. We engage with Islam as a living tradition, a vibrant faith that is constantly and dynamically being developed, challenged, practiced, and lived. The course also provides thoughtful insights into current theological debates and discussions and seeks to center the work of those who are often marginalized by "dominant" discourses and theological formulations. Although the course has no prerequisites, students would benefit from prior introductory coursework in Islamic theology and/or tradition. Area V."

"REL 949 - Spiritual Topographies in Modern Poetry and Fiction": {
	Professor: David Mahan
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This course examines the role of place, and physical space, as both setting and trope in modern/postmodern poetry and fiction. Beginning with notions of sacred space(s) from Scripture, we examine works of poetry by a range of modern and contemporary poets that explore natural, domestic, and sacred spaces (including Native American poetry) and the novels Home by Marilynne Robinson, Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy, and the urban maze of Paul Auster’s The New York Trilogy. Through close readings of these works, we consider how meaning is conveyed through the author’s development of physical locations and spaces as images of spiritual longing, journey, and presence, as well as windows into the human condition. Themes of the sacred and the profane, the material and the transcendent, good and evil, home and homelessness, identity and transformation, are among the theologically important questions that arise from this study. Area V."

"REL 971 - Creative Faith:  Poetry": {
	Professor: Christian Wiman
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "An assumption of the course is that the act of creating and the act of believing are intimately related to each other. Indeed for many artists they are inseparable. Students work on different forms of poetry, leading toward a longer final project that incorporates poetry and prose. We use a variety of prompts, imitation exercises, and small group work to generate new material. This course is part seminar and part workshop. About a third of our time is devoted to the reading and analysis of exemplary works of art. "Exemplary" in this context means, first of all, works of art that are works of art and not merely examples of spiritual writing. "Reading"—again, in this context—means reading as writers, which can be both predatory and infinitely sympathetic (often at the same time) but in any event is quite different from reading as a scholar. The rest of our class time is devoted to discussing work done by students in the class. The methods here vary, but it is safe to say that we do not always (if ever) follow the traditional workshop protocol wherein the author sits silently while his or her work is discussed by the others. We come at a student’s work in many different ways, our methods evolving with the class. Enrollment limited to twelve. Admission is at the discretion of the instructor. Area V."

This travel seminar enables participants to experience the variety of Christian expressions that form an essential component of life in Nairobi. The city has grown to become one of the most religiously pluralistic on the continent. Mosques, megachurches, and temples intersperse with glistening skyscrapers, defining Nairobi’s skyline. Nairobi's predominantly Christian population can be found in hundreds of churches from a wide range of denominations. This creates a laboratory of a kind of urban pluralism that is reshaping religion in the majority world. Participants gain a glimpse of this pluralism through the varieties of Christian spirituality in Nairobi and how they interact.

"REL 982 - Literature of Enchantment": {
	Professor: David Mahan
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "What does it mean to be enchanted? We think of states of awe, wonder, marvel, rhapsody, and epiphany, but also of strangeness, even bewitchment. What are the sources of enchantment? What makes experiences of it desirable, or dangerous? How does it relate to disenchantment, as some have labeled our modern age? Are we in need of re-enchantment―as moderns, or perennially as humans? What role does enchantment play in our sense of self and society, in our philosophical or religious outlooks? In this course we explore these questions and the many modes and moods of enchantment through the literary imagination. As resistant to a fixed definition as enchantment itself, literature of enchantment spans various genres: from fairy tales, fantasy, and science fiction, to allegory, myth, magical realism, surrealism, and blends of these elements in other forms. The works of fiction we study include those that both enchant us and are about enchantment, along with its corollaries of disenchantment and re-enchantment. One of our guiding questions from this study considers how the pursuit or experience of enchantment illuminates what it means to be human and challenges our perception of the real. Area V."

	Professor: Joan Monin
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "Social relationships, such as friends, family, romantic partners, neighbors, and coworkers, are an important part of our lives. They are the targets of our behaviors, for example, when we help, love, fight, and discriminate against others. They are the basis of our feelings of status and self-esteem and why we experience the majority of our emotions. Importantly, social relationships have strong influences on our mental and physical health. The purpose of this class is to learn about different ways of conceiving of our social environment, and how these social factors can contribute to our mental and physical health. We critically review the literature that examines the associations between social factors and mental and physical health. We address several social concepts, and in each case discuss how they "get under the skin" to influence health."

	Professor: Olivia Kachingwe
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "The purpose of this course is to provide students with a foundational understanding of U.S.-based sexual and reproductive health (SRH) advancements, ongoing challenges, and public health interventions and programs. A myriad of SRH topics will be covered ranging from abortion and reproductive rights to sexual violence. Grounded in health equity, this course illuminates how the reproductive oppression of minorities and vulnerable populations of the past are still pervasive today. The course material pushes students to examine how various determinants of health such as race and socioeconomic status affect access and utilization of SRH services, education, and technologies, which ultimately leads to reproductive health disparities and injustice. Although having a foundational understanding of current SRH challenges is important, this course is also solutions and asset focused. Thus, students explore how and to what extent efforts have been made to mitigate SRH disparities. Using the social-ecological model as a guiding framework, students explore solutions on the individual, interpersonal, community, and societal/political level. The course includes ample discussion, individual presentations, group debates, and discussion board posts."

"SBS 570 - LGBTQ Population Health": {
	Professor: John Pachankis
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "Sexual and gender minority individuals (e.g., those who identify as LGBTQ) represent a key health disparity population in the United States and worldwide, but high-quality evidence of this problem has historically been slow to accumulate. This course engages students in critically examining today’s rapidly expanding empirical knowledge regarding sexual and gender minority health by considering challenges to, and opportunities for, conducting this research with methodological rigor. Students consider social and ecological influences on sexual and gender minority health, including migration, community, and neighborhood influences. Social institutions, including religion, school, family, and close relationships, are examined as sources of both stress and support. Given the relevance of individual and collective identity and stress as mechanisms through which stigma impacts sexual and gender minority health, the empirical platform of the course is complemented by intersectionality theory, critical postmodern work on identity fluidity and multiplicity across the life course, and minority stress conceptualizations of health. Students apply lessons learned in the course to evaluating and developing policy and health care interventions for this increasingly visible segment of the global population."

	Professor: Tekisha Everette
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This course is designed to provide students with the theoretical frameworks and the practical applications of community organizing and advocacy as a means of subverting traditional systems of power and advancing health justice. Employing an intersectional lens, students analyze and discuss how they can facilitate collective action for health equity through the exploration of historical and contemporary contexts of political activism among marginalized communities in the United States.

"SPAN 835 - Latin American Energy Humanities": {
	Professor: Santiago Acosta
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The "energy humanities" is a growing interdisciplinary field that examines the cultural, social, and political significance of energy systems. In the Global North, it has gained prominence by questioning the values underpinning imaginaries of easy access to energy, technology, and transportation. This seminar, however, offers a counterpoint through the lens of Latin American cultural production, environmental history, and socio-environmental thought. In contrast to the common notion of "petromodernity" as marked by excessive consumption and resource overabundance, Latin American contexts reveal realities shaped by colonialism, extraction, uneven development, scarcity, and socio-environmental crises. These challenges, including eco-territorial conflicts and anti-extractivist resistance, are becoming increasingly urgent as the region faces the transition to renewable energy sources like wind and lithium. This seminar provides a critical overview of key approaches and debates in the energy humanities, focusing on Latin American and Caribbean perspectives. By engaging with these topics, students develop a robust understanding of how the energy humanities intersect with political ecology, environmental history, cultural studies, art history, and critical theory, grounded in both Global North and South perspectives. Course requirements include weekly writing assignments, class discussions, presentations, and a final research paper. Taught in Spanish."

"ART 017 - Spaces of Marginality": {
	Professor: Yaminay Chaudhri
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This class looks at "space" from the perspective of the outsider; it lingers in the margins, peripheries, and shadows of contemporary urban space to encourage a critical analysis of everyday experience. Each week we will unpack normative and dominant spaces by developing a keen understanding of the marginal and invisible spaces that hold them up. Sara Ahmad’s book, Queer Phenomenology, and Bell Hooks’ essay, Choosing the Margin as a Space of Radical Openness, provides the guiding framework for our inquiries as we move through various spatial formations. We scale our inquiries: from the orientation of our bodies in the classroom, to space-making walks in New Haven, to historical analysis of exclusionary zoning policies along coastal Connecticut. Throughout the semester, readings and artwork connect students to struggles for space in different parts of the world, highlighting invisible infrastructures, inequities, and voices of resistance. Classes center student discussions of weekly themes built up using a host of readings, art works, and urban typologies."

"AMST 334 - Uwe Johnson's Anniversaries: From A Year in the Life of Gesine Cresspahl": {
	Professor: No professor
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Uwe Johnson's Anniversaries: From A Year in the Life of Gesine Cresspahl remains a monument of postwar German literature – and it was written in and about New York City. Across its 367 short chapters (each corresponding to a day of the year), the novel unfolds on three levels: the historical present in New York, memories and family history from Germany, and reporting from the New York Times on current events. The result is a view of life, politics, and history in the middle of the 20th century that is as rich and expansive as it is fragmented. The social and political climate of New York in the late '60s is put into contact with memories of the rise of Nazism in Germany; reporting on the Vietnam war, the civil rights movement and the Prague Spring is refracted through the lenses of the protagonist's past life in East Germany and her new life raising her daughter alone in New York. This course undertakes a close reading of Johnson's sprawling novel with attention to its many historical, political, and literary contexts. Readings from the novel are complemented by relevant short readings on theories of media, politics, literature, and history. No prior knowledge of German language and literature is required."

	Description: "The 19th century was an age of secularism, rationality, industrialization, urbanization, and scientific and technological innovation—but it was also marked by a popular obsession with the paranormal. People from all walks of life held séances, summoned ghostly apparitions, and performed magic rituals. Why did this interest in the occult persist in the rational modern word? Exploring this paradox, this course focuses on Britain, with occasional forays across the ocean to America. Using a wide variety of fascinating sources like spirit photographs, séance transcripts, and documents in the Yale archives, we examine the origins, spread, and significance of our modern fascination with the "other world.""

"ARCH 1258 - Inclusive Design for the Built Environment II: Design Clinic": {
	Professor: Joel Sanders
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This class, Inclusive Design for the Built Environment II: Design Clinic (IDBE 2) is the second part of a two-semester practicum that teaches students an Inclusive Design approach by working with a client on an actual project. This year we’re partnering with Columbus House, a non-profit that runs homeless shelters in Connecticut, and Gray Organschi Architecture on the renovation and expansion of a shelter in New Haven which provides beds, meals, and case management for 81 adult men and women. The course builds on the work produced during, Inclusive Design for the Built Environment I: Participatory Design (Fall 2024), where students used engagement tools (surveys, interviews, and workshops) to identify the spatial barriers and solutions faced by Columbus House staff and residents using their existing facility. The outcome was the Inclusive Design Brief (I.D. Brief), a report that included project objectives, design recommendations and a detailed space program. In this second class, IDBE 2, students visualize the recommendations outlined in the I.D. Brief through a two-step process. During weekly Desk Crits, students working in Cohorts present and receive feedback about their developing designs from professors and students. Over the course of the term there will be Milestone Presentations where students present their work to a group of Columbus house staff and residents to ensure their design proposals fulfill the aspirations outlined in the I.D. Brief. The outcome is a Final Report that collects material gathered over the two semesters, including architectural drawings that document design recommendations which the Client and Gray Organschi Architecture will incorporate into the final design. Students are not required to have taken IDBE 1 to take this class. Instructor permission is required based on the submission of an Expression of Interest with the following info: Name, Class year, Major/Concentration, Email and a paragraph describing relevant experiences that would allow you to make a meaningful contribution to the class."

"ARCH 2250 - Demo: Demonstration Projects for the Viable Reuse of Aging Buildings": {
	Professor: Violette de la Selle
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "In the United States, "obsolescence" has been adopted as an economic attribute of buildings for nearly a century. In the tax code since 1931, it sets the average useful life of a buildings at thirty years. The definition might be disregarded since the devaluation aims to lower tax liability for building owners and does not reflect any meaningful material change to the building. Yet this designation has placed buildings into the realm of disposable consumer goods, inciting an appetite for new structures, and creating financial stimulus that anticipates each building’s replacement. While this dynamic supports a cyclical real estate system, it normalizes the impulse to tear down buildings which could endure much longer. This economic mechanism has also given way to a slackening of material and construction quality, which seems justified if a building is vowed to be wrecked in just three decades. Today, as we strive to limit our carbon emissions and curb global warming, the material existence of a building may in fact prove to be a distinct advantage, given that new construction accounts for 11 percent of global carbon emissions. Nevertheless, buildings of the last fifty years in the northeastern United States have generally been built to meet the urgencies of their day and have seldom been maintained or updated to ensure their longevity. How can we content with these aging buildings and their spatial constraints or material shortcomings, while transforming them for continued use and evolving environmental conditions? In this seminar, students work collaboratively to offer demonstration projects that avoid the demolition of specific buildings."

"EALL 353 - Studies in Korean Popular Culture": {
	Professor: Kyunghee Eo
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This advanced undergraduate seminar examines the dissemination, visibility, and prominence of Korean popular culture within and outside its national borders. We spend time exploring a wide variety of cultural forms such as music, film, television, fashion, performance, and new media from the early twentieth century to the present-day moment, focusing our attention on the following questions: How did Korean cultural values and historical experiences shape the content, style, and aesthetics of contemporary Korean popular culture? What is the ideological, economic, and socio-political function of popular culture in South Korea today? What makes Korean popular culture attractive to a global audience who are not necessarily familiar with the Korean language and culture? In answering these questions, we examine Korean popular culture against major historical events that took place in Korea over the twentieth century such as Japanese occupation and the Korean War, as well as the military dictatorships, democratization, and neoliberalization of South Korea. On top of conventional research writing assignments, students are also expected to produce creative essays reflecting on their own relationship with Korean popular culture and present them in class."

"CSES 220 - Writing & Living Poetry in a Warring World": {
	Professor: Michelle Ho
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Through the study of poetry, we learn how to listen—to the musicality of words, our inner lives, and each other. What personal agendas and ideas of rightness must we surrender to truly hear what a poem wants to say? When we draft a dissonant word or contradictory phrase, what if we didn’t remove it? What kind of stanza ("room" in Italian), might allow two things that stand in tension to coexist? What plural meanings emerge when we let the seemingly opposed remain in conversation, connected even if only through blank space? Each week, we read and write poems that teach us how to hold tension on the page and in our lives. We look beyond binary thinking and false peace, exploring approaches to conflict that assert our dignity, while resisting the easiest modes of self-preservation—to write off, estrange, and kill the unthinkable other. Through workshops, generative exercises, and close readings, we challenge expectations of what belongs together in a poem and make room for unexpected guests who appear at our vision’s edge—sitting down next to us in a classroom, at a coffee shop, or in the back of our minds—asking that we imagine a world in which they stay."

"ER&M 268 - What was Latinx Literature": {
	Professor: No professor
	Credits: 1
	Description: "With the arrival of "Latinx," the last decade was defined as a moment of rupture and break with traditional notions of latinidad. Artists and activists asserted refusal and historical reckoning as the mode of doing politics and aesthetics. Now, pessimistic about Latinx as a signifier of a unified political project, the generational tides have shifted to "Latine." This seminar asks what is "Latinx literature" and why are the methods of "Latinx studies" considered revolutionary or disruptive? What ideas were rooted in prior generations of feminist and queer collectives that sustained life when the arrival of a decolonial future seemed forever deferred and withheld from reach? We examine contemporary artists alongside historical antecedents to reevaluate what literary and social forms can help us challenge a racialized, heteronormative conception of citizenship. One possibility is that Gloria Anzaldúa—rightly critiqued for her relation to mestizaje —might be helpful in this moment of growing nationalism and hostility towards migrants to think about other ways of organizing life aside borders and the nation. We read across a long and varied arc of creative expression to consider forms that endure amidst colonial duress. For example: the serial, montage, anthology, performance collective, and inter-linked storytelling. Artists up for discussion may include Natalie Diaz, John Rechy, and Jesús Colón. Students will engage these works alongside theorists like José Esteban Muñoz and Juana María Rodríguez. Previously ENGL 331."

"REL 700 - Religion, Race, and Reproduction in the U.S.": {
	Professor: Jamil Drake
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "Religion (particularly Christianity) and race are two key components that are part of current policy and legal debates and decisions around reproduction in the U.S. Taking stock of our contemporary society, this course explores the role of religion and race in the history of reproductive health in the U.S. Two questions organize the course’s content: (1) How do religion and race contribute to the controversies in the history of reproduction? (2) How does "reproduction" contribute to the formation of religion and race? Such questions are explored by considering different social and professional groups and bureaucratic organizations confronting different ideologies, values, and social structures within specific historical contexts, from the antebellum to the present periods. Our course situates reproduction, race, and religion within wider debates about the "family" (particularly motherhood"), scientific and technological advancement, state regulation, professional medicine, and free choice ideology. In the end, this course helps us reflect on how and why reproduction was and remains a politically contested issue in our historical moment. Area III."

"REL 999 - Religion and Neoliberalism": {
	Professor: Todne Thomas
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "Neoliberalism is studied by scholars as a political economic ideology that enlists states to engage in the deregulation of capitalist enterprises, the retraction of social welfare initiatives, and the privatization of government functions. As a social logic, neoliberalism is associated with the extension of market rationalities into non-economic spheres of social life. Consequently, neoliberalism is associated with reconfigurations of government, changed social landscapes, and emerging markets and market ideologies. Yet, how have the changes instituted by neoliberalism given shape to conceptualizations and institutionalizations of the "religious," "spiritual," and the "ethical/moral"? What alignments and conflicts has it generated between reckonings of "public" and "private" spheres, the sacred and the secular? And, what constellations of knowledge/power, hierarchy, and counter-discourse are produced by entanglements of religion and neoliberalism? This seminar on religion and neoliberalism seeks to answer such questions by: reviewing historical and conceptual materials about neoliberalism, in particular its socio-cultural formations; examining social scientific and humanities texts that present case studies of the religious, spiritual, ethical, and moral manifestations of neoliberalism; distilling theory and studies of neoliberalism to discuss its relevance as an explanatory framework for Covid-19 governmental response and/or to generate speculative ideas about modes of reform, resistance, and alternative political economic rationalities.

"ITAL 151 - Advanced Italian Workshop": {
	Professor: Roberto Ferrini
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Forests, Deserts and Wilderness in Italian Culture. Throughout human history, non-anthropized natural environments—such as forests and deserts—have held a prominent place in human imagination. These spaces are seen both with fear and fascination, characterized as realms of risk and danger but also as places where individuals may access truths or revelations unavailable within human-dominated landscapes. Today, however, wilderness areas face the same destructive pressures as other environments, making their preservation an urgent concern of our time. This course examines the portrayal of non-anthropized natural spaces in Italian culture, spanning from the Middle Ages to the 21st century. Through the analysis of literature, visual art, and film, we will explore how humans have projected varied meanings onto wilderness in different historical periods and the insights gained by individuals who withdrew from society to experience these wild places. Furthermore, we will investigate how the concept of wilderness has reflected humanity’s self-perception in the universe: the more humans perceive themselves as central in the cosmos, the less they fear wilderness and the more they feel empowered to colonize it. This evolving attitude towards wilderness, as we will discuss, lies at the heart of today’s ecological crisis."

}
"ITAL 896 - Italian Literature as/and Philosophy": {
	Professor: Heather Webb
	Credits: 1
	Description: "In an article published in 2009, Roberto Esposito asked if it was legitimate to speak of "Italian Philosophy" and answered this question positively. In recent decades, Italian philosophers have been translated and discussed around the world ever more frequently. But what is particular about Italian thought? Esposito argues that its defining character may be found in the way in which Italian philosophical texts have always understood history, politics, and life as tightly bound together. The genealogy of Italian thought that has led to this continued flourishing and ever-growing present recognition includes Dante, Machiavelli, Leopardi, and Galileo. These authors think in forms that are sometimes understood as literature and sometimes as philosophy. They are, of necessity, both, as the full consideration of the dialectics that bind together life, history, and politics requires forms that are poetic or narrative ones. This graduate seminar seeks to interrogate the inextricable relationships between what is called literature and what is called philosophy within Italian thought, querying texts of various forms from the thirteenth century to the present day."

"HSAR 355 - Futurism: Reconstructing the Universe": {
	Professor: Pierpaolo Antonello
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course explores Italian Futurism, one of the most dynamic and controversial avant-garde movements of the early 20th century. Launched in 1909 by the poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Futurism was not only an artistic and literary movement but also a radical cultural and political project. Futurists celebrated modernity, technology, speed, and violence, often rejecting traditional art and values in favor of innovation and disruption. Futurism called for a radical revitalization of aesthetic expression through "movement and aggression."  Futurist painters, poets, writers, and musicians rejected Italy’s cultural heritage in favor of new technologies, media, and metaphors, celebrating the speed and exhilarating risks of the machine age. While Futurism borrowed stylistically from Cubism—using collage, painting, and sculpture to match its revolutionary fervor—it went beyond mere formal experimentation. Unlike other avant-garde movements, which focused on transforming artistic form, Futurism aimed to break down the boundaries between art and everyday life."

"CPLT 779 - Crossing Languages: Transnational Voices in Mediterranean Literature": {
	Professor: Amara Lakhous
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Being a transnational and translingual writer, I constantly navigate between languages. First and foremost, I "Arabize" Italian and "Italianize" Arabic, crafting stories that transcend the boundaries of language, gender, nationality, and citizenship. These boundaries often serve as tools of exclusion rather than inclusion. I also collaborate with my translators, who are usually best positioned to refine the original text. Aside from the author, no one else engages with the text as deeply as they do. The five languages I use—Tamazight (my mother tongue), Arabic, French, Italian, and English—are mirrors that reflect a new vision and style, representing my path to creativity. This course invites students to join me in exploring other translingual writers from the Mediterranean region. We examine works by authors that include Carmine Abate, Cristina Ali Farah, Apuleius, Samuel Beckett, Hector Bianciotti, Adrian Bravi, Kamel Daoud, Assia Djebar, Khalil Gibran, Gezim Hajdari, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Geneviève Makaping. The focus is on what it means to belong to a new language. These authors draw from diverse linguistic backgrounds, enriching their chosen languages with innovative styles, poetic forms, and imaginative perspectives. Students are encouraged to read the texts in their original languages: Arabic, French, and Italian."

"PLSC 240 - U.S. State and Local Politics": {
	Professor: Eleanor Schiff
	Credits: 1
	Description: "In the U.S.’s federal system, the fifty distinct state governments are often referred to as "laboratories of democracy." This phrase implies two interconnected meanings. First, different state governments innovate and experiment with various policy solutions that are tailored to their geography, specific workforce needs, and particular state cultures. This can provide policymakers at both the state and national levels to learn from states about what approaches to policy solutions may work better than others. Secondly, fifty different states (some such as California, Texas, and New York have gross state products bigger than most countries–in fact the CA economy ranks 5th in the world behind Germany and India, and Texas ranks 8th in the world) comprise a natural laboratory in which to observe and test questions about political institutions, representation, political behavior, policymaking, and public opinion, among other topics. In this class, we take a comparative approach to studying state politics, using an analytical approach to understand the variety and variability of issues facing states and different approaches to solving societal problems. This course addresses both how the states themselves are substantively interesting, as well as how they are used to understand broader issues in political science and governance."

"HIST 425J - Urban Global Health: From the Colonial to the Post-Colonial": {
	Professor: Gourav Krishna Nandi
	Credits: 1
	Description: "How have today’s global megacities, the majority of which are based in erstwhile colonized countries, come to function the way they do? Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, colonial cities emerged as pivotal conduits for the flow of global capital and commerce that was threatened during periods of conflict and disorder, such as wars or outbreaks of epidemics. This seminar explores the history of public health in today’s megacities throughout the Global South. In the first part of the course, students examine colonial public health interventions and disease control measures–such as anti-plague measures, vaccination campaigns, slum clearance, and health education–to better understand how colonial, and later, postcolonial states planned urban spaces, and managed and restricted the movement of populations. In the second part, we explore how colonial and postcolonial states have attempted to govern the urban poor and migrant communities and the diverse ways in which migrant and urban poor communities have actively contested and reclaimed urban spaces. Using case studies of Global South cities from Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, the Philippines, Senegal, and South Africa, we pursue a comparative examination of how colonial and postcolonial states have variously utilized outbreaks of epidemics in cities to create newer strategies to control and manage urban populations and spaces, and how marginalized communities have challenged state interventions and assert their belonging in urban spaces."

"HIST 331 - Delightful Dangers: Cultures of Consumption in South Asia (1850-1945)": {
	Professor: Siddhartha Mukherjee
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course explores the consumption patterns that emerged due to South Asia’s increased integration with the global market. By looking at objects ranging from soaps, beauty creams and drinks on the one hand to sewing machines, bicycles and cars on the other, we examine how material goods were advertised as bridges between global consumption practices and specific local contexts. It is argued that such entanglements were crucial to portray the commodities as keys to ‘joyful lifestyles.’ We then demonstrate how their consumption was linked to the characteristics of and aspirations for new class identities and changing gender norms. While noting how commodities opened pathways of social mobility, the course also explores how they evoked new anxieties structured by the dynamics of class, caste, gender and colonial rule. It is by situating the commodities within such larger socio-political contexts that we trace their diversified reception. As diverse actors began to have access to industrially manufactured goods, a deeply uneven and contested experience of being 'modern' emerged. By following commodities in circulation, the course demonstrates the ambiguities of this multi-faceted development."

"LING 376 - Implicature and Pragmatic Theory": {
	Professor: Laurence Horn
	Credits: 1
	Description: "How can we distinguish lying from intentionally misleading? Is lying always worse than mere deception? How does perjury differ from garden-variety lying? How should journalists distinguish lies from other false statements in a "post-truth" era? For linguists and philosophers, the key theoretical question is how to assess the roles of intention, content, context, and interlocutors’ goals in distinguishing lying from merely misleading, a distinction that informs and is informed by the corresponding dichotomy in (neo-)Gricean pragmatic theory between what is said and what is implicated. Since Augustine and Aquinas, the characterization of lying has focused on the role of speakers’ intentions, as well as on the difference between assertion and (mere) implication. One who hides the truth or tacitly encourages the hearer to draw a false inference has traditionally been regarded both within and outside the courtroom as less culpable than one who overtly lies. But is this impression empirically justified? We survey cross-linguistic differences in evaluating of lying vs. misleading, semantic vs. ethical criteria in determining when a falsehood counts as a lie, the relationship of lying to speaker commitment, the theory of the justified lie, and the ways to not quite lie—sarcasm, bullshit, puffery, and bluffing."

It takes as a starting point the centrality of mysticism to the very founding of Islam, exploring the various ways that Muslims have sought to encounter God through the knowledge of the unseen (ʿilm al-bāṭin) for well over a millennium. The course aims to highlight the diversity implicit in such expressions of divine reality (ḥaqīqa) by exploring the various characteristics that both connect and distinguish Sufi communities from medieval Delhi to contemporary Khartoum. Through translations of primary sources, a rich secondary literature, and a vast library of Islamic art and aesthetic production, students will be acquainted with the central themes defining the study of Sufism and Islam more generally. Sessions consider Sufism’s relationship with other forms of esoteric knowledge; Sufism as an effort at self-purification; the institution of Sufi Orders (ṭarīqas); Sufi aesthetics and intellectual history; shrines, saints, and Sufi social practice; and Sufism’s complex relationship with Islamic reformism among others. Rather than a comprehensive overview, the course aims to provide students with a solid foundation for engaging in key theoretical debates on issues of mysticism, orthodoxy, practice, and religion broadly."

"JDST 121 - Work, Rest and Leisure: A History of the Jewish Sabbath": {
	Professor: Sarit Kattan Gribetz
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The Sabbath is one of Judaism’s core institutions: a weekly day of rest, worship, and community. The Sabbath was an innovation of ancient Israelite communities, who had the unique practice of dividing time into seven-day cycles and marking the seventh day as sacred – a practice of timekeeping that was later adopted by other societies and empires, and that is the dominant division of time in many parts of the world today. What are the origins of the Jewish Sabbath? How did traditions and practices of the Sabbath develop in different historical periods and diverse communities? How do sources about the Sabbath conceptualize the sanctity of the day? What role did the Sabbath play in social and cultural life among Jews and between Jews and others? How has the idea of the Sabbath manifested in other realms, such as the human rights movement, labor unions, and ecological activism?  This course explores the topic of the Sabbath through biblical passages and papyrological sources, texts from the second temple and rabbinic periods, and legal, documentary, literary, philosophical, mystical, liturgical, poetic, and material sources from antiquity to the present in order to understand the Sabbath, past and present."

	Professor: Sarit Kattan Gribetz
	Credits: 1
	Description: "A passage in the Babylonian Talmud prohibits a man from greeting his friend at night for fear that the nighttime figure might be a demon. Another passage permits women to immerse in a ritual bath during the day only if certain local dangers make nighttime immersion too dangerous: lions in Naresh, robbers in Papunia, cold temperatures in Pumpedita, and gatekeepers in Mahoza. How did individuals and communities across the ancient world imagine, define, and organize the night in diverse places and periods and why did they do so? In this seminar, nighttime is both the subject of study (when did the night begin and end, what did various groups do during the night, how was the night described?) and a mode of analysis (a new angle through which to explore important topics such as religion, social history, time, gender, class, status, technology, travel, intercommunal relations, biblical interpretation, and so on). Throughout the semester, we analyze many sources about the ancient night, including: diagonal star clocks from Egypt, depictions of nighttime scenes painted on Athenian vases, continuous nighttime study described in the Dead Sea Scrolls, musings penned by Roman philosophers as they burned the midnight oil, night metaphors in the New Testament gospels, innovative medical practices that tracked hours of the night for more accurate treatment, glass lamps hung on doorposts in the Roman provinces, Christian hymns sung in the dark, and incantations inscribed on metal amulets or ceramic. By the end of the course, each student authors an independent research paper related to their own area of expertise that employs a hermeneutic of the night."

"AFST 352 - Culture and Politics in Lusophone Africa, 1885-1992": {
	Professor: Benedito Machava
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The peculiar nature of Portugal as a colonial power produced a very distinct history in the five Portuguese-speaking African countries, namely Angola, Guiné-Bissau (Guinea-Bissau), Moçambique (Mozambique), and the Atlantic islands of Cabo-Verde (Cape Verde) and São Tomé e Príncipe. Lusophone Africa is a lose term that refers to the world created by Portugal’s colonialism in Africa. This course explores this distinct history through the lens of culture and politics. Focusing on the long twentieth-century, we consider Lusophone Africa as a study unit, dissecting its disparate societies, cultures, and political trajectories, while remaining anchored in the general context of Africa. Military conquest, colonial rule, race/lusotropicalism, nationalism, and liberation struggle are some of the core themes of the course. We begin with a brief assessment of Portugal’s efforts to retain its colonial enclaves amid the voracious expansion of British, French, Belgian, and German presence in Africa in the late 19th century. But our focus is on the twentieth-century, from the establishment of the colonial administration in the early 1900s to the fall of the Portuguese empire in 1974. We dedicate a good portion of the term to exploring the multiple ways (cultural and political) in which Africans responded to Portugal’s encroachment and how they navigated the color bar that came to dictate their social mobility under colonial rule. We end with the multifaceted longings for self-determination that led to the longest and bloodiest liberation wars in Africa. Our readings include scholarly essays (old and recent), primary sources, literary works (novels, poetry and short stories), photographs, music and films. We become acquainted with Portuguese-speaking African voices, faces, and places. Luís Bernardo Honwana’s collection of short stories in We Killed Mangy Dog and Other Stories (1964) and Zezé Gamboa’s film The Great Kilapy (2012) carry us through the important theme of race and race relations. While cautious in situating the discussion of race in its historical context, these and other materials challenge us to think about race relations and emancipation in our time."

China’s rapid growth and adherence to a state-oriented economic model, however, combined with globalization’s challenges to the liberal economic system, have significantly increased tensions between the world’s two biggest economies. This course examines the factors driving economic friction between the United States and China, and is divided into four sections. The course is taught by a practitioner who spent over a decade managing U.S. Government economic policy in and on China."

"HIST 497 - One-Term Senior Essay": {
	Professor: Anne Eller
	Credits: 1
	Description: "All senior History majors should attend the mandatory senior essay meeting in early September at a time and location to be announced in the online Senior Essay Handbook.
The senior essay is a required one- or two-term independent research project conducted under the guidance of a faculty adviser. As a significant work of primary-source research, it serves as the capstone project of the History major. Seniors writing a two-term senior essay do not register for HIST 497; instead, they register for HIST 495 and HIST 496 (see description). History majors may choose to write a one-term independent senior essay in the first term of their senior year and register for HIST 497; however, students who choose the one-term senior essay option are not eligible for Distinction in the Major. The one-term essay must include a substantial research paper of no more than 6,250 words (approximately twenty-five pages) based on primary sources, along with a bibliographic essay and bibliography. Seniors enroll during the fall term of senior year; only History majors graduating in December may enroll during the spring term (or seventh term of enrollment). In rare circumstances, with the permission of the adviser and the Senior Essay Director, a student enrolled in HIST 497 during the fall term may withdraw from the course according to Yale College regulations on course withdrawal and enroll in the spring term. Each student enrolled in HIST 497 must present a completed Statement of Intention, signed by a department member who has agreed to serve as adviser, to the History Department Undergraduate Registrar by the dates indicated in the Senior Essay Handbook. Blank statement forms are available from the History Undergraduate Registrar and in the Senior Essay Handbook, available on the History department Web site. Additional details about the senior essay, including the submission deadlines are included in the Senior Essay Handbook. Essays submitted after 5 p.m. on the due date will be considered as having been turned in on the following day. If the essay is submitted late without an excuse from the student's residential college dean, the penalty is one letter grade for the first day and one-half letter grade for each of the next two days past the deadline. No essay that would otherwise pass will be failed because it is late. All senior departmental essays will be judged by members of the faculty other than the adviser. In order to graduate from Yale College, a student majoring in History must achieve a passing grade on the departmental essay. Permission of the departmental Senior Essay Director and of the student’s faculty adviser is required for enrollment."

"LING 109 - History of the English Language": {
	Professor: No professor
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The story of the English language is a remarkable one. During its 1,500-year history, English has gone through striking changes. For example, in the early Middle Ages, the word take did not exist in English; it was later borrowed from the language of the Vikings. When a person in the 16th century claimed that someone was nice, they meant that the person was foolish. In the 17th century, her could be spelled har, her, hor, hur, and hyr by people living in the same community. And more recently we see how like has taken on new functions, especially in quotations. We will explore how and why these, and other developments took place. We look at how major historical events have spurred changes in the English language, and how people from all walks of life (from well-known authors like Shakespeare and Austen to anonymous scribes and letter writers) influence the path of change. Exploring these questions will also force us to consider whether we should more appropriately be talking about "histories of Englishes" rather than "the history of English." By the end of the course, you see how the English you use has been shaped by people and forces over several centuries, and how you yourself contribute to the continuing change of the English language.

After beginning with a recent issue of Radical History Review on "Old/Age," we spend our weeks discussing topics such as ageism and age discrimination; immigrant caregiving and servitude; black debility; creative iterations of queer and trans aging; age standardizations in the early twentieth-century United States; "deaths of despair" amidst "the new longevity"; feminist critiques of optimal aging; and junctures of disability and aging. The course brings together a range of thinkers including historians such as Corinne T. Field and Nicholas L. Syrett; theorists such as Kathleen Woodward and Margaret Morganroth Gullette; disability justice activists such as Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha; and sociologists such as Mignon R. Moore. Two governing concerns that we answer as a class: How do considerations of age, aging, and gerontophobia featured in our readings amplify the contemporary investments of American studies? How can we chart political and aesthetic formations of the frail that offset their persistent nonrecognition?"

"CPLT 614 - East German Literature and Film": {
	Professor: Katie Trumpener
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The German Democratic Republic (1949–89) was a political and aesthetic experiment that failed, buffeted by external pressures and eroded by internal contradictions. For forty years, in fact, its most ambitious literary texts and films (some suppressed, others widely popular) explored such contradictions, often in a vigilant, Brechtian spirit of irony and dialectics. This course examines key texts both as aesthetic experiments and as critiques of the country’s emerging cultural institutions and state censorship, recurrent political debates, and pressing social issues. Texts by Brecht, Uwe Johnson, Heiner Müller, Christa Wolf, Johannes Bobrowski, Franz Fühmann, Wolf Biermann, Thomas Brasch, Christoph Hein; films by Slatan Dudow, Kurt Maetzig, Konrad Wolf, Heiner Carow, Frank Beyer, Jürgen Böttcher, Volker Koepp."

"ECON 672 - Behavioral Finance": {
	Professor: Nicholas Barberis
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Much of modern financial economics works with models in which agents are rational, in that they maximize expected utility and use Bayes’s law to update their beliefs. Behavioral finance is a large and active field that studies models in which some agents are less than fully rational. Such models have two building blocks: limits to arbitrage, which make it difficult for rational traders to undo the dislocations caused by less rational traders; and psychology, which catalogues the kinds of deviations from full rationality we might expect to see. We discuss these two topics and then consider a number of applications: asset pricing (the aggregate stock market and the cross-section of average returns); individual trading behavior; and corporate finance (security issuance, corporate investment, and mergers)."

"GLBL 6520 - Social Entrepreneurship in Public Health": {
	Professor: Teresa Chahine
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This is a case-based course about innovation and entrepreneurship for health equity and drivers of health. Health equity means that everyone has a fair and just opportunity to be as healthy as possible. This requires removing obstacles to health such as poverty, racism, gender, and other biases and their consequences, including powerlessness and lack of access to good jobs with fair pay, quality education and housing, healthy foods, safe environments, and health care. We refer to these as drivers of health. COVID-19 has brought to light for many the complexities in drivers of health, and the role of entrepreneurship and cross-sectoral collaboration in eliminating health disparities. Students examine cases of entrepreneurship for health equity in the United States and globally, using a research-based framework to analyze the role of innovation and design thinking, resource mobilization, financial viability, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and systems strengthening. Cases include start-ups and new ventures within existing institutions, referred to as intrapreneurship. Students also examine cases of collective impact, or innovating across multiple institutions. Over the years, students in this class have begun referring to these as extrapreneurship. This course brings together students from Yale College, the Graduate School, and the Schools of Management, Public Health, Environment, Divinity, and Engineering & Applied Science."

	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This seminar focuses on the practice of wildlife and wildlands conservation, examining key topics from the dual perspectives of academic literature and actual field experiences; bringing together interdisciplinary thinking; and drawing on examples from Africa, Asia, Latin America, and North America. The thematic outline of the seminar is organized around three fundamental questions in nature conservation: What are we trying to save—and why? How is this being done—and how has it changed over time? What lessons are we learning—and what overarching issues remain problematic? Specific topics include how different players define and value wildness; selection and prioritization of conservation targets; comparisons of various species and landscape conservation approaches; and governance and decision-making in conservation, including ties between conservation and development and community-based conservation. During the term, students work in small teams to assess one of several current case studies—integrating biological, social, economic, and governance considerations—to propose an effective path forward for conservation. Participation and leadership are key, as the seminar is discussion-based and approximately 25 percent of the sessions are student-led. Evaluation is based on participation, presentations, and a final paper."

Examples include how startups can achieve product-market fit, convert consumer needs to MVPs, and assess traction and when to pivot; how growth-stage firms can prioritize features, balance competing strategic objectives, and develop channels that scale to new markets; and how enterprise firms can conduct systematic product innovation and optimize products at scale. The course will provide hands-on opportunities to apply course material on real PM problems from leading technology firms. We will accordingly cover technical skills required of PMs, including basics of technology-driven products (e.g., the software stack and modern cloud ecosystem); the interplay with design, UI/UX, and product marketing; and how to develop statistical hypotheses and conduct A/B tests.""

This course provides an introduction to the field. We revisit basic topics in finance from a behavioral finance perspective: topics related to markets (stock market fluctuations, popular investment strategies, bubbles); topics related to investor behavior (poor investment decisions by households); and topics related to corporate finance (security issuance, mergers and acquisitions).

	Professor: Nicholas Barberis
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "The traditional framework for thinking about financial markets assumes that all market participants are fully rational. The past two decades have seen the emergence of an important new paradigm, behavioral finance, which argues that many financial phenomena are the result of less than fully rational thinking and which draws on psychology to understand the ways in which people are not fully rational. This course provides an introduction to the field. We revisit basic topics in finance from a behavioral finance perspective: topics related to markets (stock market fluctuations, popular investment strategies, bubbles); topics related to investor behavior (poor investment decisions by households); and topics related to corporate finance (security issuance, mergers and acquisitions). A running theme in the course is that knowledge of behavioral finance is essential for anyone who seeks a full understanding of modern financial markets. There are no prerequisites – the course is self-contained – but some students like to take it in conjunction with the Spring-1 course MGT 854, "Behavioral Economics"."

	Professor: Nathan Novemsky
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This 6-credit, project-based course gives students exposure to some of the complex questions and challenges on the minds of top marketing executives today. In this experiential learning course, each small group of students will be paired with a leading corporation and will work alongside experienced faculty and advisors to tackle a current business challenge. This course applies theories in Behavioral Science to help uncover the drivers of consumers’ beliefs and motivations. These insights will then be used to meet the real-world marketing challenge and results will be presented to high-level managers within the participating firm. Students will learn how to go from problem to solution in real-world situations. Each five-member student team will meet at least once per week as a group, and will attend weekly faculty advising meetings. Approximately 10 mandatory lectures / course events will take place on Wednesdays from 5:45-7:15PM EST, dates TBC. This course is by application only; there are no bid points assigned.

"MGT 654 - Data-Driven Value Creation in Healthcare and Life Sciences": {
	Professor: Leon Rozenblit
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "Data has become critical to driving value and innovation in the healthcare and life sciences sectors. The explosion in data processing capabilities and wide adoption of data collection during routine care processes have created opportunities to reduce costs, increase efficiencies, speed therapeutic development, improve care, and, ultimately, better patients' lives. However, along with the opportunities, the explosion also created hidden risks for data-powered businesses. This course will equip students with the knowledge and skills to build sustainable data-driven businesses within the healthcare and life sciences sectors. We will begin by surveying the healthcare data ecosystem and turn to how the data generated by the system can create business value. Along the way, we will become familiar with the foundational concepts of healthcare informatics and the sub-discipline of clinical research informatics, which provide essential frameworks for understanding how to generate, manage, and use healthcare data. We will then look more broadly at models for treating data as an asset and consider how those models apply to healthcare data. We will wrap up by exploring how to assess the business value of healthcare data and how to build processes that enhance that value. In this course, students will shift between two informative perspectives: that of a healthcare data analyst charged with assessing and recommending a healthcare data strategy and an entrepreneur assessing new opportunities in the space. As we work through identifying opportunities and challenges, we will practice asking essential questions and gain first-hand experience in research and business-process-analysis methods used to answer them. We will also examine innovative businesses focused on healthcare data and analytics."

	Professor: Jayanti Owens
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This course helps students understand what bias is, why it matters, and how it shapes inequality in important organizational processes (e.g., teamwork, hiring, advancement). We will also examine what the science says about whether, when, and which strategies can help reduce bias in organizations. We begin by understanding scientific evidence around how bias can operate as an interpersonal, organizational, and structural process and how it can impede organizational effectiveness. We then examine strategies for reducing the effects of bias both among individuals at the interpersonal level and among organizations as it exists within organizational cultures. We will also examine where the science is limited and why reducing the effects of bias in a sustained way can be difficult. Finally, we will address strategies for fostering inclusive organizational cultures and creating organizational change. Importantly, this course will focus on bias and inequality along lines of race/ethnicity and gender in the U.S. because this is where the science is most developed. However, we welcome student discussion around how the principles we discuss can be extended to global organizations and to other dimensions of difference along which bias can operate (e.g., social class background, nationality, LGBTQ identity, religion, disability, and more). This course is designed for students who want to become sophisticated thinkers about how employees from diverse backgrounds experience bias and inequality in recruitment, evaluation, and advancement, what the science says about how organizations can foster inclusion, and what they can do as individual managers and leaders to promote diversity and inclusion in their workplaces and in society more broadly."

The course is organized around a series of cases (largely focusing on investment led by or involving SOM graduates) that allow us to dig deep into decisions made by PE firms in implementing value creation strategies — • What messages is the firm getting from their own investors (such as institutional limited partners?) • What quantitative and qualitative tools can be brought to bear to help frame decisions? • How does a firm identify, diligence, and quantify salient market and operational factors in framing a value creation plan? • How does the firm gain confidence in its ability to execute on a value creation plan, and assess the risk around that plan? • How and should the firm incorporate ESG factors into decision-making? The class will be limited to 20 students. Preparation and class participation are strongly encouraged. Some cases will be done individually, some in teams."

"MGT 818 - Global Virtual Teams": {
	Professor: Yoshinori Fujikawa
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "The primary goal of this course is to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to lead, manage, and operate effectively within teams that are both global and virtual. The pandemic has significantly shifted the way we work, creating changes likely to persist. While virtual work offers many potential advantages, managing virtual teams presents unique challenges. These challenges are especially pronounced in global virtual teams (GVTs), where cultural differences, time zone variations, and other issues can hinder team effectiveness. This course builds on foundational principles of managing organizations, groups, and teams through an action-learning approach, allowing you to apply knowledge and skills in practice. You’ll participate in exercises that simulate the issues faced by GVTs, focusing sometimes on the "global" aspect, sometimes on the "virtual," and often both. The course is structured into three modules: • MODULE 1 | GVT Class Sessions | 16:10-18:10, Tuesdays and Thursdays, January 21, 24, 28, 30, and February 4, 2025 | These exercise and simulation-based sessions build on concepts and frameworks introduced earlier in the curriculum, aiming to deepen your knowledge in building, managing, and leading effective teams in global and virtual settings. • MODULE 2 | GVT Negotiation Exercise | January 30 – February 28, 2025 | Jointly conducted with 10+ GNAM partner schools, this module places you in a GVT with students from different schools around the world. You’ll complete an interactive learning exercise involving team-building, coordination, decision-making, and cross-team analysis. This assignment provides real-time, hands-on practice implementing lessons from Module 1. • MODULE 3 | GVT Debrief Workshop | 16:10-18:10, Tuesday, March 4, 2025 | We will reconvene for a final session to share your experiences and insights from the GVT Negotiation Exercise."

The colloquium offers Episcopal and Anglican students an opportunity to engage in reflection and discernment on their experience of formation for religious leadership, lay and ordained, providing an opportunity to integrate varied theological disciplines. While leadership skills and capabilities can in some measure be taught abstractly, they are most effectively integrated into one’s formation through exposure to seasoned leaders in various institutional contexts. Students explore a wide variety of leadership skills and styles in the presentations at the colloquium and the assigned readings. Students practice leadership skills through role-playing, improvisation, and case studies. The intention is to set a leadership context in which students can practice leadership lessons that can be adapted to a ministry environment. Each term of the colloquium focuses on different leadership skills. Over the course of their participation in colloquium, Berkeley students are exposed to, and given an opportunity to practice, valuable leadership skills for ministry. These colloquia are required of all Berkeley Divinity School students wishing to qualify for the Diploma in Anglican Studies."

"CSBF 220 - Red Sea Rising: A Modern History of the World’s Most Contentious Waterway": {
	Professor: Ethan Chorin
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course provides a comprehensive overview of a tumultuous region whose relevance to geopolitics, international trade, US foreign policy, and global climate policy is often greatly underestimated. After a quick tour of the 'state of play' in the region today, the class provides an overview of the ancient history of the Red Sea, and its role as a connector between Mediterranean, African, Asian, and Persian civilizations. We then trace the impact of colonialism, Cold War rivalry and extremist ideologies on diplomacy and conflict among contemporary Red Sea states. We examine the present-day political, economic and military dynamics between and among these states, and the ways they connect to global rivalries, trade, and peacebuilding efforts. We examine the reasons for multiple state collapses (notably in Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Yemen) and possible longer-term outcomes, and the dramatic transition underway in Saudi Arabia. The course also looks at  ways the inter-related issues of population growth, resource management, and migration will shape the Red Sea’s future. Finally, we ask what it would take governance-wise for the Red Sea to become a conflict-dampener or "neutral zone", as opposed to a conflict magnifier."

"PORT 120 - Elementary Portuguese II: Places of Memory": {
	Professor: Mariana Centanin Bertho
	Credits: 1.5
	Description: "In the second semester of Portuguese, students continue to deepen their understanding of the language and cultures of the Luso-Brazilian and Lusophone Africa worlds by engaging with interdisciplinary themes. Instead of traditional textbooks, students explore diverse authentic materials. This course invites students to explore lugares da memória (places of memory) to analyze how subjectivity is shaped by the spaces we inhabit and how modern transformations of these places impact our relationship with the environment. Organized into four content units, "What is Culture?", "Anti-Touristic Guide", "Displacement of Memories", and "Ludic Spaces", students create a variety of projects (clips, podcasts, story maps, video essay, puppet theater) that explore the interplay between language and culture, our perception and connection with cities and sites of diasporic memory, food as historical and cultural heritage, and the loss of playfulness in adulthood. The course engages students through a variety of genres and paced activities focused on comprehension, contextualization, reflection, and creation of new meaning. By the end of this course, students have developed an understanding of the language and cultures across various textual genres and gained deeper insights into multiple aspects of Portuguese-speaking world. Students can submit their productions for publication in the Yale Portuguese Students’ Digital Magazine. Conducted in Portuguese."

"PLSC 421 - Politics of Authoritarian Regimes": {
	Professor: Alexei Zakharov
	Credits: 1
	Description: "The goal of this course is to provide an understanding of undemocratic regimes — something that more than one-half of the world’s population is forced to contend with. The study of authoritarian regimes is a key subfield of modern political science and utilizes a variety of methodologies and both qualitative and quantitative analysis. More broadly, it is a part of the social sciences discipline, exploring human behavior, society, and the structures and systems that influence the way people and institutions interact and organize themselves. We start by looking at how authoritarian regimes differ from democracy and also from each other, proceeding to examine the threats that autocrats face and the measures they take to maintain their rule, such as building or dismantling institutions, distributing patronage, hiring the right subordinates, manipulating public opinion, rigging elections, and suppressing dissent. Other actors, including the opposition, face their own problems when contending with or challenging autocratic rule. We proceed to look at the ways in and out of the autocracies — how democratic rule becomes subverted and how it is re-established. We examine the impact of authoritarianism on the economy and foreign policy, as well as on values, cooperation, and the fabric of the society, and whether and how these effects persist and reinforce authoritarian rule. Finally, we look at the effect of technological change on the evolution of autocracies, as it can empower citizens of autocracies but also strengthen autocratic control over them."

"PLSC 132 - Public Opinion in Post-Soviet Russia": {
	Professor: Boris Sokolov
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course introduces the major debates shaping contemporary Russian public opinion. We start by briefly reviewing Russian history and the key political thought currents that still influence Russian politics today. Next, we discuss the methodological challenges of studying public opinion in authoritarian regimes. Then, we consider several specific issues that divide Russian society. These include, competing views of Russia's past, the dynamics and roots of mass regime support, prevalent political attitudes and cultural values, economic preferences, attitudes toward gender roles and sexual freedom, nationalism, ethnicity, and views on immigration, and foreign policy attitudes, including perception of the U.S. Finally, we delve into the opinions of Russia's elite on domestic and foreign policy, and address the sensitive topic of public attitudes toward the invasion of Ukraine. The key goal of this course is not only to review key trends in Russian public opinion but also to explain their major social and historical drivers. In simple words, to explain not only what Russians think about various things, but also why they think that way.

Of course, being able to read or watch in Russian will certainly help you get a much broader picture of the subject. However, all readings will be available in English, and no assignments will require any knowledge of Russian for successful completion."

	Professor: Michelle Oing
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "This course explores the concept of "patrimoine," or cultural heritage, as it has been used, reimagined, and reinvented across French history. Organized around case studies of nationally protected sites, buildings, and artworks, students synthesize scholarship on the history of these important cultural artifacts with theoretical debates around cultural heritage, museological approaches, and the tourism industry. Special attention is paid to the ways in which the official French policy of secularism (laïcité) has affected the country’s approach to the preservation and display of religious monuments and works of art in the modern and contemporary eras.

"REL 729 - Liturgy in the City of Rome": {
	Professor: Tyler Sampson
	Credits: N/A
	Description: "The city of Rome looms large in the history of the medieval West and the Church. But how did a pagan imperial city become the center of the western Christian world? This seminar traces the story of Rome from Late Antiquity to the Renaissance through its unique confluence of monuments and ritual. It queries how the bishops of Rome used the liturgy of the Church to construct a Christian city and how that city lived with its classical past. Following the monuments and liturgy of Rome across history allows us to engage with the city as it was encountered and experienced by potentates and peasants alike and to trace the long path of the city’s Christianization and many attempts to renew itself. We read a mix of primary sources and modern scholarship. All texts are available in English. Knowledge of Latin, French, German, and/or Italian will be helpful, but not required. Area II and Area III."

"GREK 465 - Hippocratic Writings – Medicine & Human Nature": {
	Professor: Malina Buturovic
	Credits: 1
	Description: "This course offers an opportunity for in-depth study of what are perhaps the two most famous treatises of fifth-century Greek Medicine: Airs, Waters, Places and On the Sacred Disease. Our emphasis is on learning familiarity with their language and style. But this practice of close reading gradually opens onto larger questions, including: why did medical writings of the fifth century focus so persistently on human nature? What did these texts mean by human nature? What influence did their debates over human nature have on later theories, and how should we weigh this influence today?"

"ART 294 - Technology and the Promise of Transformation": {
	Professor: Sarah Oppenheimer
	Credits: 1
	Description: "Inherent transformative qualities are embedded within technology; it transforms our lives, the way we perceive or make art, and conversely, art can reflect on these transformations. Students explore the implementation of technologies in their art making from pneumatic kinetics, bioengineering, AR, VR, and works assisted by artificial intelligence—modes of production that carry movement, degradation, and displacement of authorship. The student practice is supported by readings, independent research, and essays on diverse artists and designers who make use of technology in their work or, on the contrary, totally avoid it. This course is a curricular collaboration with The Center for Collaborative Arts and Media at Yale (CCAM)."
